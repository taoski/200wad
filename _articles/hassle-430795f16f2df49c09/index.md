I am still on the fence regarding reselling a WordPress plugin that I have fixed to work with an API.

The community who use the plugin are crying out for it, but I am wary about getting too involved.  I don't mind using the updated code on my own websites, but providing support to others is just hassle.

I am also thinking about the original developer, who is too ill to look at updating the code base.  How would I feel if I were him, that someone else was hacking his code, fixing things and then profiting from it?  It's possible that I could get in legal trouble!

I could offer the fix for free, but would still end up having to support people who have specific issues with their sites.  I am only changing 2 files in the plugin structure, so people would have to manually update those 2 files themselves (taking a backup first of course).  It all just feels like too much effort to get involved with.

Sure, the money would be nice, but we are not talking a massive profit anyway.  What is the time/effort/stress cost associated with that profit?  Which is better?

I have done this sort of thing before.  The developers of a previous software product went missing and the RSS feed the software used, changed format overnight.  I updated their code and resold the fix to their users, making a good profit.  After a few weeks, even the developers came and bought a copy of my code and assimilated it into theirs.  They never said anything to me about it though.

A real solution would be to create my own version of the plugin, charge a monthly subscription fee and offer a support forum with regular updates and enhancements.

But that too sounds like wayyyyyy too much hassle :)
