So long and thanks for all the fish!

Just wanted to stop by on this final day and wave farewell to you all.

It's been a rough ride for me, plumbing the depths of my mind was fun, shocking, revealing, therapeutic but also slightly triggering.

But, I have (virtually) gotten to know some great people.

Hope to catch up with you online somewhere else at some point in the future!

Many thanks, Bas!
