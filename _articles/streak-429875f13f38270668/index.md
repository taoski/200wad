I was making some toast when I remembered that I didn’t write yesterday and have lost my streak.  I had opened my laptop in the afternoon and sat, staring at the MyDraft page, wondering what to write.  Then, something else happened that took away my attention and the streak was lost.

Never mind.

It’s not the end of the world.

In a way, it could be a good thing, a chance to reinvent myself and take a different focus or direction.  I don’t feel bad that I have lost the streak because it is a chance to start again.  I have to remember why I am doing this and the streak is only a very, very small part of it.

I awoke before 7, ran 6k in 30 minutes, then sat in the quiet of my garden to cool down and sipped water with my eyes closed, listening to the birds and the distant hum of cars.  The cat came and affectionately brushed up against me.  Everything was silent, cool, crisp and fresh.  I have lost my streak.  And I don’t care, because everything is still good with the world.
