You won't find me in da' club,  
I will be at home making dinner like I always am'

Yes, I have successfully lived a full 49 years as of today!

I feel 49 years old today too.  My sinuses and ear is still blocked and I just want to crawl into bed and hide.  Now that the lock down has been eased, my workload has increased massively and there seems no end to the emails and notifications "bing-ing" and "bong-ing" all day long.  I can tell when I have had enough of work when my phone rings and my initial response is "Oh... fuck off!!!".

I share my birthday with my best friend.  Despite him being a 3-hour drive away, we have been chatting all day.  He is also a depressive and (reformed) alcoholic, fed up with where his life choices have taken him, too weary to see the way back, resigned to plod towards that cliff-edge he feels is coming.

I wonder if all birthdays will feel like this now?

I am too exhausted to enjoy it or see any positives.  Even my parents popping to have a celebratory socially-distanced cup of tea and some cake just felt like a hassle.  Of course I love them, but didn't really feel up to it.

Anyway, the dinner is cooking, so I better finish this up.  No doubt everyone will be annoyed we are not having an Indian take-away as they suspect.  I would love one too, but I can't be bothered with the effort it will take to get one.

Happy birthday to me :)
