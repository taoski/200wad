Recently, I have the feeling that the world is spiraling out of control.  Not just the pandemic, but also the geo-politics, wars, corruption, famine and lack of respect for one another.  The real problem is that I believe it is almost impossible to solve.

I often wonder who could be a good spokesperson, to take the world on and try to make them listen to sense and reason, getting them to act like better people.  It would need to be someone who is respected by everyone, across all religions, races and political parties.  Someone without bias or outside influence who could speak from the heart, mind and soul without confusion.

I guess the answer might be someone religious, but as an atheist, I wouldn't want that to happen.  It might as well be Yoda.  It would be impossible for them to try to remain agnostic whilst trying to convince people to become better.  There is only one clear answer as to who could take on this task.

Aliens.

If they were to arrive, admit they had been watching us for thousands of years and decided they better come and course-correct us, putting us back on the rails and heading in the right direction - that would work.

Either that, or they could release their anal-probe-bots to roger some sense back into us when ever we strayed from the correct path.

Won't wear a mask in the store?  That's a probing...

Spending your political party's funds to renovate your third home?  That's a probing...

Perhaps it could become the a socially-distanced sport?

Two teams of petty criminals and Twitter trolls take on the corrupt politicians and weakling billionaires in 4 rounds of The Maze of Death.  The teams have to work to evade the fleet of anal-probe-bots, whilst also making sure their opponents lose their pants in the process.

No pants at the end of each round?  That's a probing...
