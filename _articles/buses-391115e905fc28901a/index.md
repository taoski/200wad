It was a different time in the 1970s in England.

I just half-watched an old comedy film from 1971 called “On The Buses” which was a feature length adaptation of a television show of the same name.

It is an atypical British comedy of that time, with constant references to sex, boobs, women “wanting it“ all the time and promiscuity oh and some more boobs too.  Throw in a health dose of low cut tops, racism, sexism, homophobia and bad teeth and you have all the makings of a British classic.  Anyone who has ever watched a Carry On film will know what I mean.

I wonder how our current film and TV will be seen in the future?  Will we look back and think it was horrendously un-PC and out of touch, like we now can with FRIENDS.  Or will they still be seen as our classics?

I guess those from the 1970s will see On The Buses as a classic whereas others will frown at it, thinking it to be unsuitable for todays audiences.  I remember the TV show more than the film and at the time, it was funny.  However, I just find it nostalgic now more than anything else.  I remember the funny characters more than when they regularly stopped off mid-bus journey to “have it off” with a sex-mad housewife who’s husband always returned in the middle.

Perhaps these things really happened in the 1970s?  It wasn’t that long after the free-love sixties after all!
