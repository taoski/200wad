Last week, I was driving my wife back from an appointment and we pulled up to a large, busy roundabout on the edge of town and sat in traffic, waiting for the lights to change.  It was 5 PM, what counts as rush hour for the UK.  The rain drummed on the roof and my automatic wipers were going into overdrive for no reason.

To my right was an old building, probably several hundred years old.  It had been extended, modernized, double-glazed, but was still reminiscent of it's original design.

The town were I live is on an old Roman road stretching between London and the north of England.  It is well know for being a "tavern town" where people would stop and rest for the night and is steeped in history, even getting a mention in a Shakespeare play.

Many of the original Inns and Taverns are still there, have the same name and feel as they did years ago, despite the prolific number of televisions inside showing all manner of sports.  The original fireplaces still roar in the winter whilst you snuggle up with a frothy pint of local ale.  The smaller pubs and hostelries that closed are now houses but still retain the old-world look.  On some, you can see where the original Inn sign was hung.

Looking through the rain at the old house next to the busy roundabout, I wondered what the original owners would think now.  Their beautiful home that would have at one time been the gateway to their town, now caked in car fume pollution, constant noise and glaring lights.

I think I have seen pictures of this house in books and being shared in Facebook groups where we laud the memories and history of our town whist also praising the new takeaway pizza shop opening where the old family run butcher or corner-shop once was.

I caught a glimpse of how the house might have looked back then, before the cars and concrete.  Surrounded by farmers fields, a muddy road passing by and a very nice desirable property.  It would have been a quiet and homely place to live.

It made me feel quite sad.

The red LED traffic lights eventually changed to green and I followed the throng of cars across the roundabout and towards the old town.
