When I had depression, I used to have feelings that, when trying to achieve something, it just didn't _feel_ right.  I would sit to write, draw or make something, repair a plug, play a game or watch something I used to enjoy but there was a nagging "janky twerk" in my brain that just made me feel uncomfortable.

It is almost like a magnet pulling me away from what I am trying to do, attracting me back to the ease of sitting and doing nothing.  Or it is like a mental recoil from a bad smell, or a shiver or sneeze that never arrives.

It is hard to overcome this feeling and I still get it today, despite supposedly being free of the black clouds.

As I am writing this, thinking of examples and trying to narrow down what it is, I am imagining using my iPad to draw a picture and can feel the feeling come over me.

I sometimes think that it is a feeling that my mind or body is lacking something, searching for a feeling or a hit that it is not getting.  Twenty years ago, I might have had a spliff or cigarette when feeling that way.  More recently, there have been times when I have this "janky twerk brain" feeling sitting at my work laptop that I feel could be resolved by bashing my head against the nearest kitchen cabinet or reaching for a can of lager.  It feels like a hole that cannot be filled.

Is it that I lack having feeling for things now, that everything I try feels instantly empty, worthless or stupid.  I know losing interest in things you used to enjoy is a classic sign of depression - perhaps this is one that will stay with me forever?
