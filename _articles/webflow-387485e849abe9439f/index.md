I spent the morning messing around trying to recreate something in Webflow.

It does highlight the weakness in my CSS skills, not really knowing the box-model or where DIVs, CLASSes or inline blocks come and what they all mean to each other.  Coming from WordPress was not a total leap into the dark, but I am glad I wasn't hand-coding in an IDE.

Luckily, I had found something I could practice on!

A few months ago a friend who "Doesn't do WordPress" had a client for whom he had designed a basic HTML and CSS site (non-responsive too I might add - he also "Doesn't do mobile").  The client subsequently wanted a blog and he had set up WordPress in a /blog folder, but wanted the theme design to match the rest of the site.

He came to me, knowing that I had some experience with WordPress.

To set this up, I just took the existing HTML template file, added the small WordPress header/footer code at the top and bottom and then told WordPress to get the blog post content in the middle.  Essentially, it is just a single file for the entire theme.  Very quick and dirty, but works - especially when the client has still yet to write their first blog post.

I thought I would try to recreate this site in Webflow and managed to create the homepage (large background image, a centered menu and the artists name in the middle of the screen) and a single "info" page (simple header with social links too and some content) before I ran out of free things to play with.

Seems you can only create 2 pages on the free account.

The client is an artist, so I was looking forward to trying to create a collection or gallery page too.

Never mind.

I am not going to pay for something I am only trialing/messing about with.

I know I am on a learning curve , but I did find it hard going.  I had to Google a few issues which were sometimes because Webflow was working in a strange way (not changing the menu link colors) or my lack of understanding modern CSS (flex boxes).

Maybe redoing the entire site with WordPress and Elementor might have been easier after all.  But again, not something I am particularly versed in either :)
