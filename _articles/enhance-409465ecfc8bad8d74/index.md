"Hello blank page, my old friend.  I come to write with you again."

You are not a mirror showing who I am, merely an enhancing lens, improving my vision and clarity like the infinite "Enhance!" from Blade Runner.  Through my writing, I can zoom in and focus on specifics, exploring their texture and meaning, then zoom out to see how it all fits together.  Writing can become a revealing truth.  Forcing myself to write how I am feeling gives me clarity and focuses my mind.  My head, heart and hands connect and I am more free, lighter and hopefully wiser.

I sometimes flounder in the white emptiness of the blank page, grasping for stories, thoughts, ideas or words that will mean something to someone.  I want to help people, but I am still stuck trying to help myself.

If I don't know who I am, how can I help others?
