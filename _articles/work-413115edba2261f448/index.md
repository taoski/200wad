Now that people are returning to a "new normal" work-life, the projects that were temporarily put on hold are coming back out of the woodwork.  The problem is that the project managers haven't adjusted their GANTT charts to extend any deadlines.

So now, I am faced with rolling out a new product by the end of July, which I have yet to test, to a network environment which is not set up properly.  I only need to arrange the rollout to 620 different locations, all with their own separate network requirements and peculiarities.  Our customer has been aware of this new product since last year and was under the impression we were already testing it.  I am sure they will be "chipper" when I tell them they have to reconfigure their WAN to allow it to work.

On top of that, I have also been re-engaged on another project to migrate 110 sites to a new naming and configuration convention.  Again, this project is pushing forward within tight timescales and they are planning to convert around 20 locations per week.  Based on similar projects I have done in the past, this could take me out of any other support work I do, so it will also have to be costed accordingly.  They think we are going to do it for free :)

I am glad in a way though.

The last few months have been deathly quiet with many of the locations I support being closed due to Coronavirus.  I have still been performing proactive support tasks and admin work, but the main daily support tickets dried up.  When I created my monthly reporting for the customer, I was a little embarrassed to record the number of tickets we worked on in May.  Then again, as my boss says, a low number of tickets is testament to the stability of the service and product we provide.

My only real issue is that my colleague is quite disengaged with the job.

He does the bare minimum and is not interested in getting involved with other more major projects.  He has been screwed over time and time again by various managers and has never been able to progress his salary or grade for one reason and another.  I totally understand where he is coming from, but at the same time, hate that it falls to me to do everything.  On top of helping my wife with her masters degree dissertation, my head is often spinning by the end of the week.
