I am still trying to persuade my friend to start writing, advising him that medium.com is probably the best place to get started.  I believe that diving straight to hosting his own blog, battling with SEO, WordPress and hosting, will be too much for him.  At least with Medium, you have the opportunity to reach an existing audience quite quickly.

My idea was that he could write there, make some extra cash and evolve from there to his own site, books, blogs or other platforms.  He has the skill and ability, he just needs a nudge in the right direction.

However, he will need to find some good topics to write about though.

His immediate view was that Medium was just "clickbait shite".

Yes, the majority of the more popular stuff always is.

*   "10 ways to use Trello after your man has an affair"
*   "6 peanut butter recipes for iPhone addicts"
*   "9 killer resume tips to help you win your next DUI charge"

Luckily, there are some more serious articles to be found under the [Editors Picks](https://medium.com/topic/editors-picks) section on Medium, so I sent him there to read (armed with the [Readium bookmarklet](https://sugoidesune.github.io/readium/) to bypass the paywall).

I did worry he might not do so well without stooping to the lows of sensationalist titles and more viral content.  But we shall see how he gets on.

I am not even sure he is taking the idea seriously, yet :)

Next, I will have to educate him on [how to write for the web](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html).  No walls of text, headings, links out to relevant content and sources and the odd GIF here and there to make it fun.

I hope he can make some headway.  He deserves it.
