It's another one of those Sundays.

My wife is working away on her university work in the corner of the room, the children are either out, or busy upstairs.  I am just sitting, scrolling through Reddit, Twitter and Facebook and occasionally checking the football scores.

I am just killing time.

I have nothing better to do, or nothing I have the energy to do or nothing I want to do.

Sure, the oven hob needs cleaning, the bathrooms need cleaning, I need to vacuum downstairs but am keeping it quiet for my wife.  The dishwasher needs to be emptied, clothes washing probably needs doing and there is plenty of DIY to be done too.

But, I will just drift through the afternoon, helping my wife when she needs some assistance and perhaps we will pop out to the local garden centre soon, to get some compost for some new plants we have.  But after sorting that, I will be back to doing the same thing.

Scrolling through Reddit, Twitter and Facebook.

My ear is still blocked and ringing and my sinuses are still playing up.

I will just blame it on that.
