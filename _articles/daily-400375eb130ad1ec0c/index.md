_"Become familiar with your voice on paper."_

That was a quote from the latest episode of [Graysons Art Club](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/graysons-art-club/on-demand/71402-002), a TV show about creating art during this lock down and time of uncertainty.

He had done a quick interview with [Maggi Hambling](http://www.maggihambling.com/work), a chain-smoking eccentric British painter, where she was extolling the daily practice of painting and drawing.  She recounted how she goes to her studio every day and starts with a drawing to "warm up" before moving on to painting or sculpting.  She said that if she is ever ill or is not able to do her daily work, then it "sends her more potty than ever!"

When asked what her advice about creating art would be to people during this lock down, she replied:

_"To make a drawing every day and look at the great masters.  If you draw every day, most people have got half an hour when they are not worried about their fridge freezer or something, then it becomes like breathing, drawing being like ones handwriting, the most intimate thing that one does.  Of course, it's therapy."_

Grayson then followed up, in one of his more lucid moments, that we should try to draw, paint or create every day.  The line I quoted at the beginning was his parting thought and it struck a chord with me, reminding me of the writing I am doing here and my struggles to find my passion, what I am or what I should be.

I do have a daily practice of creating here, but I feel as if I am rambling all over the place without an authentic voice.

I wish I was Grayson or Maggi, able to express myself through creativity.  I wonder where I would be now if I had gone to art school.  9 years ago, I posted some old drawings and paintings I did when I was at school to Facebook.  An old school friend, who I was not really that close to, commented this, which has stuck in my brain for years now:

_"I hope whatever job you are doing now allows you to express your creativity."_

The truth is that it doesn't.
