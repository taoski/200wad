Like my wife, my brother is also on a life-long learning journey.  He has more degrees and qualifications that I can, academically, shake a stick at.  He and my wife are qualified in a similar area, so have lots to talk about, including the courses they are taking.

This usually leads to him asking me "What about you?  What course are you going to do?"

To which I always reply "Nothing.  Especially if it is work related!"

For some reason, I was thinking about this regular occurrence as I was in bed trying to sleep.  I imagined myself saying to him and my wife "Nothing.  I am just the enabler."  Meaning I am there to allow others to achieve what they want, not do it myself.  I get my satisfaction by helping and watching others succeed.

I am not sure where the term "enabler" came from.

Probably a half-dream subconscious, reaching out to me with words I might never find during my lucid times.

I don't see that being an "enabler" is a bad thing though.  However, there is a little nag at the back of my brain telling me that I should also be "enabled" as well as "enabling".

Maybe, those who can't do, teach.  And those who can't achieve, enable?
