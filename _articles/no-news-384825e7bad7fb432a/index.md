I noted to my wife just now that I had read someone on Facebook advising people to only watch the news once per day at the moment.  This is to avoid being crushed by constant information, possibly biased in one direction or the other.

In our house, we tend to have the TV on from the moment my wife gets up to the moment I go to bed.  I am usually up first and like to sit in silence for a while and also tend to go the bed 30 minutes after her too.  But for the rest of the day, we have the TV on as "background noise" whilst I work and she studies.  Our children are up in their rooms, connected to Spotify and YouTube - they hardly consume traditional TV at all.

Perhaps tomorrow, as a test, I will suggest we turn the TV off after we have finished our breakfast and use Alexa to listen to the radio.  We won't be immune from the stories of the day, but will hopefully get less obsessed with it and be able to carry on our day without too much worry.

I also have to go food shopping tomorrow morning for the first time in 2.5 weeks.  That will be enough stress for one day, let alone constantly hearing what mess the UK government or Trump is getting us all into all day.
