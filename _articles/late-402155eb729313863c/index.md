Leaving it too late again to make a proper post here.  Got caught up helping my wife edit her assignment for most of the day.  I am trying to remind myself I get to help her with her work and try not to become too annoyed when she pulls me away from whatever I am (not) doing to help cut 500 words from her 1000 word essay.  I am trying to reframe my involvement if I can and I enjoy helping edit.  I can be a grammar nazi when I need to.

After the editing and dinner were done, we watched Triple Frontier on Netflix which wasn't too bad for a "Straight to Netflix" movie.  It followed the story of a bunch of ex-army hard men, taking out a Pablo Escobar character who hides in the jungle with all of his money.  They are all semi-retired, so go back for "one last job" to kill the drug lord and steal his money to keep for themselves (which I am sure is a legal grey area).

Of course, nothing goes quite to plan but I did think it was an entertaining film nonetheless.  Nice to see that they all didn't make it out alive (spoiler!) and that they didn't end up rich in the end.  Well.. maybe one of them did if he can get the girl.
