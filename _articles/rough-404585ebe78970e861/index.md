I have been starting to feel rough over the last few weeks.  Each day, my stomach is just growling and building up stomach acid that burns in the back of my throat all the time.  As soon as I eat a meal, my stomach is working overtime, destroying what it has been provided, gurgling loudly and making me burp and be bloated.

The acidic feeling seems to also be present in my chest.  I can't tell if it is tightness in my lungs, pain from acid reflux or back pain transferring around my rib cage to my sternum.  My shoulders and neck also feel tight too, possibly from running yesterday.  It's a feeling that puts me on edge, where I am restless and not sure how to sit comfortably.  According to my running watch, my heart rate is slightly elevated too.

Along with all that, I think I have been grinding my teeth when I have been sleeping.  This had lead to some amazing headaches when I wake up, like my face is in a vice.  It also seems to have had some knock on effects to my sinuses which feel dry, inflamed and irritable.

I have been taking my temperature, which is normal, but I feel like I do have a slightly higher temperature than normal.  If I touch my body or face, it feels warm to me, but my wife says I have cold hands, so it could be that too.

So, the hypochondriac in me is wondering if this is the start of COVID-19 getting me, or if I am suffering from some sort of stress related illness.  Perhaps it is some sort of other sickness or infection, its hard to tell.
