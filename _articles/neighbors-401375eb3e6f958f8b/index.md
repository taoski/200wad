Our next-door neighbors are moving out today.  They have been renting there for about 1.5 years but we have never really spoken to them.  I offered to move my car a little so they could more easily carry their furniture out and we ended up chatting.  Shame we hadn't done it sooner.

My wife and I both admit that we are both a little reclusive, shy and introverted when it comes to making friends, especially with neighbors.  We have only been close with several of them over the years and that was mainly due to one of them being our Son's teacher for a while, or where our kids were the same age and went to to the same school.

On the other side, our neighbors are originally from London, the anti-social capital of England and are very quiet, keeping themselves to themselves.  We say hello and send them a Christmas card each year, but don't do anything other than that.  Of course, it is fine to be that way and I wouldn't want to be in the situation my parents were at their old house, where trying to escape a talkative neighbor meant one of us pretending there was a phone call my Dad needed to urgently take.

Perhaps when the new tenants move in, we will try to be more friendly.  We are hoping it will be a younger professional couple as the rental pricing in our road and town usually prohibits "those types of people" you wouldn't want as neighbors.  Yeah, I sound a bit of a snob.  Seeing as are still in lock down, we are not even sure if and when it will be occupied.

We shall see and hope for the best.  We don't want to be "best buds" with them, but if we can share the odd coffee or beer passed over the garden fence on a sunny day, all the better.  I don't want to be the confrontational person who knocks to tell them to keep their noise down.  Similarly, I hope they will be able to appreciate that both of our sons are musicians :)
