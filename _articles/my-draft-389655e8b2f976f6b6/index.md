I will share a little secret now.  It's actually quite bad.

When the virus was increasing in intensity, the thought flashed through my head that people I know, my parents, my wife, my children, friends, even ME might die from this.

"At least it will give me an excuse", I thought.

Whoa.  Let's let that sink in for a moment.  The thought of my dying from this horrible disease, on that day didn't seem like a bad idea.  I saw it as an easy way out, a perfect way of leaving this life without any blame.

It was only momentary, but the thought has stayed with me over the weeks.  Not in a way where I am actively considering licking every surface outside of my home each time I go for a walk, but it has lingered in the back of my mind.

I sometimes feel I am on a predetermined plan.

I have convinced myself that I will die from cancer.  Every ache or tiredness I feel is the start.  Each shallow breath I find myself taking is the heavy weight of lung disease.  My IBS, twisting and contracting my stomach and intestines, exacerbated by drinking alcohol every day for the last few weeks and enough tea to drown a horse in, feels like something rotting inside, taking over.

And with this predetermined plan, I have a predetermined act planned.

I have thought about how I will handle having my fears confirmed.  How I will walk away from the hospital and disappear.  I wouldn't want to put my family though the pain of seeing me suffer.  It would be easier to go.
