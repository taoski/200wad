I am having another "messy" day where nothing seems right, feels like it fits or gets done properly.

That elusive "state of flow" won't be achieved as I am flitting from one work thing to the next, stopping to make food, comforting my wife because her laptop is running slow (my fault, it seems) and then the phone rings again or I nearly miss my next meeting.

In my case, the "flow" of which they speak, is really just a steady stream of shit :)

The worst thing to happen today is that I need to migrate several gigabytes of files previously stored on a network drive to a new Sharepoint site.

Due to the way Sharepoint (or Shitepoint as I now know it) works, combined with the locked down profiles on our laptops, there is no way to upload files and folders in bulk. It kind of works, but then stops quite quickly after and pretends the Sharepoint WebDAV drive is not even formatted. The only way to do it, is to manually recreate the folder structures and copy the files up section by section.

Of course, this should have been the time we could have gone through the files, zipped up what we didn't need to access all of the time and kept the rest. But no, it needs to be done as soon as possible so my managers can access what they need.

But, the phone keeps ringing, project work is getting in the way, emails arrive and meetings are held. I am losing the plot with it all to be honest.

And where is my colleague who could be picking up any new stuff?

No idea. Somewhere on the end of the IM chat app, probably chilling and watching TV as I fight the fires.

Now.

I am sure I need to update a spreadsheet with some new information about a server I migrated. But which spreadsheet am I using? Is it on my desktop or Shitepoint? Did I check it out, and will Internet Explorer be the death of me?

Agh!
