Today is the first day the UK has left lock down.  We are allowed to leave the house for exercise as many times as we want, sit and eat our government approved meal of cucumber sandwiches and drink Yorkshire Tea from a china teapot in the park with members of our household and even meet one person from "the bad, evil, nasty outside world" as long as we keep at least 2 meters apart.

There is an [old custom](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/customs/) from British parliament where speakers from the two opposing parties are separated by a distance of two sword lengths and one inch, designed to keep them from beheading each other when votes about funds to fill potholes in their constituency doesn't go their way.  Perhaps now is the time to reintroduce this custom.  I'm sure I won't get into trouble walking to the local shop with my sword drawn, pointing at each person as they approach.

The lock down here hasn't been without it's fair share of frivolous scandal though (apart from the criminal lack of PPE in care settings and the hidden death toll in care homes).  A Scottish health minister resigned after tabloid newspapers published photographs showing her travelling to her second home, despite her being the mouthpiece of the "Stay At Home" campaign.  A UK science adviser to the Prime Minister, who prompted him to impose the lock down, also had to resign after it was revealed [he had met with his married lover](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/) several times, with her coming to his house for her daily exercise, I assume.

In my mind, we are still in lock down.  The "Stay At Home, Save Lives, Save The NHS" mantra is still burned on my mind and at the moment, nothing will sway that ideal.  I only know of one person who has died from COVID-19, a lady who my wife knew, who lives a few streets away.  So in reality, where I live is probably quite safe, but it doesn't stop that OCD style worry in my mind that I might catch something from increasing complacency as opposed to tongue-kissing random strangers or licking every surface I see in the supermarket.

The entire handling of this crisis by the UK government has been lacklustre at best, possibly criminal at the worst.  It will be interesting to see if any of the government ministers resign over this whole debacle in the coming months, or if they will disappear from view, suffering from stress or PTSD like our doctors and nurses probably will.  There is only so much of a smiley face you can put on when thousands of people around you are dying on your watch.
