I have had a lazy day today.

My wife and I watched the TV coverage of the London Marathon, had some lunch, sat on the sofa playing with our phones and just chilling out.

An Amazon delivery came with a new smoothie blender, so I gave that a whirl too. It is my attempt to start eating more fruit. I am ok with vegetables and salad, but don't each much fruit. If I can whizz up some left-overs from the fruit bowl after each run, that will help. Not sure I will migrate to Kale though. We shall see.

I did a little bit of coding to fix a problem with a premium WordPress plugin I sell. Someone contacted me to point out an issue which I didn't spot initially but still needed fixing.

I then added a new function to the plugin for him, which might benefit others, but I won't release it yet as an upgrade until he has tested it. As with many thing, "feature creep" comes along where someone wants the plugin to do a specific thing that no-one else will use. I just add these sorts of ideas to the list of possible upgrades in my Trello board, never to be seen again.

One thing about not doing much all day, is that I end up feeling bad. I feel I should be filling my time with something more productive rather than just relaxing, especially when that relaxation just involves scrolling through Reddit or reading the football scores on Twitter.

I wonder how much time I waste on trivial shit and then berate myself for not doing things I might enjoy.

Of course, the real reason is that I don't feel I am able to do those "things" I might enjoy. It involves effort, time, concentration, silence and some form of passion.

That's one by-product of depression, nothing you want to do seems enjoyable, or feels like too much effort.

It's much easier to do nothing.

And look, another football match is on soon. Time to check Twitter again.
