My 49th birthday is only 2 days away now and yesterday I noticed that my wife was scuttling upstairs quite often, probably to arrange present buying with our Sons.  There have been knocks on the door from delivery drivers, intercepted before I get up to answer and what looks like a card delivered.

It makes me feel uncomfortable.

As I wrote the other day, I can't think of anything I would like as a present, ever.  My stock answer if anyone asks, is "Nothing.....".  And it is the truth.

I would rather receive a card and nothing else, which sounds a little ungrateful and cantankerous, but I would be fine with that outcome.  It all feels like such a lot of stress for everyone.

I can remember the first time I felt let down by my birthday gift.  I guess I would have been around 12 or 13.  I was interested in Bird Watching (what pubescent teen in the 1980's wouldn't be??) and my parents bought me some binoculars on my birthday.  I took them up to my bedroom window, from where I could see our bird table and feeder, and I immediately felt like they were a worthless present.

Perhaps I was just at "that age" where childish things were to be put away, but I was not old enough (or the family was not well off enough) to get something more lavish, like a portable TV for my bedroom.  Or perhaps, around that age, when my body was under duress from the dreaded hormones, was when my depression started to show its ugly face.

I remember using the binoculars and feeling disappointed with my gift.

Since then, I have always felt a bit awkward opening presents, especially when the family are all sitting there, waiting to see my reaction.  It's not that I am faking being pleased I got a new T-Shirt, just that it never hits my pleasure spots as much as me buying gifts for others.

I don't think it has been like that every year for over 30 years, but it feels like it.
