I feel weary today.

Everything feels like an uphill battle, through thick sludge and in heavy boots.  I am pushing that dung ball all the way up this heap of crap, only for it to roll back down again when I wake up.

I am pretty much carrying my department on my own.

Since lock down, my colleague has been working at home too, but only picking up a small percentage of tickets as they come in.

Our tickets are split between "Incidents" where something has broken and needs fixing or investigating and "Service Requests" where there is some form of a planned change to something.

Looking at the stats for July 2020, they break down as follows:

### Incidents

Closed total = 106

Closed by Twizzle = 93 (87%)

### Service Requests

Closed total = 31

Closed by Twizzle = 30 (97%)

This is pretty stark evidence that I do more work.

I can also add to those figures that I have been managing issues with one of our suppliers, working on a major new software roll out project and preparing for a customer migration at 90 sites.

I only know these stats because it is one of my monthly tasks to create the reporting.  Yet another thing I have to do, not including managing the customer billing too.

All of these things are not exclusive either.  I am doing lots of things at the same time and there were quite a few times when I should have logged a ticket to cover my time, but forgot.  Someone called, or emailed me to help and I did, so that 87% should actually be a lot higher.

Add to that all of the things I have to do at home too and I am ready to burst.

In my stupor, I sometimes fantasize that this is not my last life, that there is some sort of do-over.

When is it my turn?  My turn to get a break?  When will someone make me a cup of tea?

Last night, I dreamed of stabbing myself in the hand and wrist with a screwdriver.  Not trying to kill myself, but when I awoke, there was a stabbing pain in my hand.  Possibly the first signs of RSI or carpal tunnel.  Either that or arthritis.

But I can't complain.  Not that I don't want to, I just have shit loads of work to do.

Sure.  I get paid more than my colleague, but it's no wonder I feel so fucking weary.
