I better get my writing done now, before the hours swallow up my free time and I am left wondering where the day went.

I feel the weight today from all of the moving objects circling my head.  Things I have to do, things I want to do, work projects, things I haven't done, things I shouldn't have done and the pull of annoyance, passion, fear and uselessness all at once.  Add to that the constant interruptions from my wife whilst she is working on her dissertation.  She expects me to instantly comprehend, understand, appreciate and be able to critique things I have no idea about.  I help as best I can, but it is hard work.

I guess you could class it as a form of low level anxiety.  I feel tight in my innards and am unknowlingly clenching my jaw, making my teeth and head hurt.  The background shrill of tinitus is always there.

I need to get out and run, feel the fresh air and become free of this screen.

But I suspect my wife will want to walk instead.  Which is fine, of course, but she will want to talk about her writing and nothing else.  So it won't be any sort of break for me.  I will just nod, humm and ahhh along when needed.  It usually works.
