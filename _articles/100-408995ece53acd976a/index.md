One hundred!

I have hit the "Big C" (in Roman numeral language) and also reached the number of times you have to tell you children not to squirt toothpaste all over the side of the sink, before it eventually becomes a habit.

One hundred is also the age in the UK where you receive a birthday telegram from The Queen, thanking you for putting up with queuing, freebasing teabags, commenting on the weather every hour, being sarcastic and tutting under our breath rather than challenge someone trying to push in the queue in front of you.  Of course, those who are near to 100 years old are usually the only people in the UK who still respect the Royal Family, looking beyond their "indiscretions" and dodgy business deals.

Those of us who are fortunate enough to live to one hundred often put their longevity down to a regular daily tipple of whiskey or sherry.  Although, the number of centenarians who also extol the benefits of a fry-up breakfast, no exercise and 60 fags a day are also sharing the same care homes.  It all comes down to genetics in the end.

Me?  I am just glad to be here :)
