I wonder how long it will be before I am feeling stressed about writing here, trying to fit it into my weekend of doing things for other people.

Right now, I am worried about my son who is at a gig 60 miles away and has the distinct possibility of missing his last train home.

I have spent the day doing things for others, again.

Roll on Sunday :/
