Another day of heat here in the UK is getting me down.  I am just not built for sunny weather.  Being British, I am more used to a rainy, windswept summer with the odd day of slight gloom.  Sun is as welcome as a soggy biscuit dropping into a mug of tea after too much dunking.  it just spoils everything.

When I am on holiday, sitting at a hotel in Greece or Spain, I can cope with the heat.  It's not just that "it's a different kind of heat" as my Mother always says, it's the fact that I am usually only a few steps away from belly flopping into a swimming pool.  I guess for people who live in parts of the world where heat is a constant, private pools and aircon are considered a basic necessity to support life.

The hottest weather I have experienced was in 2015.  We took a 3-week family trip to Las Vegas, San Francisco and LA and the moment we stepped out of the airport terminal in Vegas to catch a taxi, we were hit with an oven-blast of desert air.  I think it was 40 degrees that day and we were toast.  Toast that was burned at the edges, jet-lagged, sore, thirsty and hungry and in awe of the Vegas toytown experience.  After dropping our bags at The Luxor and wandering the strip for an hour, I was so dehydrated that I caved in bought 4 bottles of Kiwi water from a Starbucks.  That was an expensive mistake.

Back home, I am trying to remember to drink water in between our royalty-regulated hourly cups of tea.  I am still sitting here in my shorts with my top off though, sweating profusely.  A slight chance of rain was forecast earlier this morning but it never came.  No doubt the thunderstorms promised for this evening won't appear either.

Oh well.  I will have to endure another night of being stuck to the duvet - and not in a good way ;)
