We did our usual last night before bed.  We watched a TV show and then left it on the same channel whilst we scrolled on our devices.

A show came on that I was not familiar with called [In My Skin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p06myb3d/in-my-skin-series-1-episode-1).  One of the main BBC channels shows more edgy stuff at around 11 PM each day, usually from their online-only sister channel, BBC3.  This was one of those shows.

The story follows three teenage friends from Wales, dealing with drink, drugs, school life, bad or mentally ill parents and poverty.  Quite depressing stuff really.  But there was an additional thread running through the show about poetry.

The main character, Bethan, who's mum suffers from Bipolar and who's dad looks to be a good-for-nothing drunk, is showing a passion and skill for writing poetry.  At the end of the show, one of her teachers picks her to be featured in the yearly school anthology.  An achievement that brings her the adoration of the more academic people in her class and scorn from her pill-popping, fuck-it-all friends.

I am not sure why, but I love this sort of thing.

I am not sure if it is because I wish for that all-consuming love and passion for something that I lack at the moment, or if it is the teacher taking Bethan under her wing, encouraging her to create.  Perhaps I have a need for my own expression that is not being fulfilled.

It also reminds me of the feeling I get after watching Dead Poets Society.  Prose and poetry breathes life into young peoples minds under the guidance of Robin Williams.  Art and poetry is life and their lives are consumed by it.

In the show last night, after reading a poem she had written that was quite stereotypical and weak, her teacher told Bethan "Speak from the heart, that is what I want.  Life is art."

That line struck a chord in me.

I wouldn't know how to start poetry.  I wonder if there is an online course I could follow, but one where I could have a teacher give feedback.

Another one of my pipe dreams, no doubt.
