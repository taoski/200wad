This morning, after a bad nights sleep because of me snoring like a zombie, which made my wife wake me up constantly to tell me off, I stumbled from under the covers at 6:45 AM.

I wobbled my way downstairs, got my running gear on, had a small drink of water and a Dextrose tablet and headed out of the door.  There is supposed to be a few very warm days here in the UK, so running in the evening is not something my body could cope with.

I prefer running in the cold, icy air.  Heat bogs me down and when I left the house, it was only 13 degrees Celsius.

I actually had quite a good run in the end.

I thought I would get round the corner and feel the sluggishness in my head and legs, the pull of the duvet grabbing at my ankles, temping me back to dreamy slumber as I plodded along.  But not today!

The sun was still quite low and there was still a little coolness on the breeze.  I hugged the shadowy sides of the streets, under tree canopy's, through underpasses and alongside walls.  By the time I had reached 3 kilometres, I felt that I had a good rhythm going and wasn't struggling at all.

Due to lock down and that it was still only 7 AM, the world was also very quiet.  There were not many cars on the roads, only a few builders vans parking up to collect people on the way to their work.  However, there was an abundance of runners and dog-walkers.  But it is nice to make a signal or nod to the runners as you go past; you both know the pleasure and pain of the early morning run.  Kudos to you, sir!

I arrived back home at around 7:30 AM, poured myself a pint of water with some fresh lemon juice squeezed in, grabbed a banana and sat in my shady garden.  It was still cool enough to help me recover and peaceful enough that it felt like a little slice of meditation to start my day.

I reviewed my run on Strava, which showed a good pace, perfect cadence and that my heart wasn't about to explode at any point during the run.  Compared to how I felt running in the heat over the last week, my heart was thanking me.

However, If I did the same tomorrow, I might not be able to repeat the same success as today.  My next running day is Thursday, when the temperature is supposed to be even hotter.  So again, I need to venture out early.
