I awoke early this morning and busted out a good 10k run. My wife wanted me to help her write a business plan, so I knew my day might be taken up with that.

She found a guide and we tried to start filling it in.

It reminded me of some training I have done in the past. Find your audience, work out their pain points, find your niche and serve them.

At some point she will get to the financial side of her business. It would be useful to know what monies she can write off, such as the cost of me making her a WordPress site. I wonder how expensive I should be, for her tax purposes.

It's all new ground for both of us.

I have worked as a sole trader in the UK for years, submitting tax information once a year to keep the law off my back. But once you go beyond that, to form a real business with real assets, I am in the dark.

Should be interesting to fill it all in.
