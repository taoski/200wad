Around the Millennium, when blogging was still fairly new, I once read a quote:

> "The worst kind of blogger is the passive sort, the ones who never engage."

The quote actually refers to bloggers who never comment and just consume content. But, for some reason, it has stuck with me for all these years.

It makes me feel that just "being" is not enough. I also need to engage, get involved and do something. Otherwise, everything is just noise, words, pictures and the odd bad smell (oops!).

Of course, the word "blogger" could be exchanged for anything.

A writer who reads and never starts his own story, or a musician who listens to music too much without making their own. A parent who is never interested in what their children enjoy.

I feel it applies to my life in general.

I always feel that I have a passive life, going with the flow, watching and waiting for my turn which will never come, never engaging fully.

> "I am a human doing, not a human being."

This was another quote I used to have as my blog tagline, back in the year 2000.

Nothing feels like it has changed for me in the last 20 years.

Of course, this is not strictly true if you look at me from the outside. To some people I am the most important thing to them, both in my personal and professional life. My whole family depend on me for almost everything and the multi-million pound contract the business I work for services, hinges on me to deliver most of it.

But whilst these soppy platitudes and accolades are nice, it's what is inside me that is important.

That is what I need to work on.

To stop being passive and engage with everything more.

But I am not sure how.

Years of having depression have made me disassociated from everything. I don't feel anything important any more. Well, not stuff that I should care about. I can tear up over someone winning a silly show on TV, but when a family member dies, it just bounces off.
