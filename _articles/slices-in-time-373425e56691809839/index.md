I was chatting with my colleague yesterday about my old office I used to commute to in Birmingham.  I spent 5 years commuting there by train and had a really good time.  We were looking on Google Streetview at how the places there have changed after renovation.  I then discussed how I used to travel to another office there before I could drive and found that too.

When I started to think about that office, I got a small "slice of memory" about it.  I remembered the office layout, the smell, the people, the feeling I had being there.  And then, it was gone within a second.  Hence, I call it a "slice" - so thin, it vanishes before I can fully appreciate it.

I had a similar "slice" just now, when I was walking to a local shop to get a sandwich during my lunch-break from work.  From a road-bridge I could see a school playground and the kids all running and shouting during their break-time.  Again, I had a "slice" of a memory of what that felt like: to be a child, running and playing games with your friends in the cold and windy playground.  Replaying the same games over and over each day without much worry.

And again, it was gone within a flash of a second.

I wonder if people also experience memories like this?

Or are they able to go deeper and retain those feelings and get more involved with those memories?

It seems to be something I just can't do or get a grasp on.  Things in the past have happened and seem distant, like they were not part of my life.
