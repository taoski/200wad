We popped out last night, to visit one of my old school friends who was back in town to start clearing out his Dad's house after he passed away.

Apart from the opportunity to see him, it was also a good excuse to take a look in the house, which we estimate will sell for well over £1m.  It is a huge grade 2 listed building, with many rooms, bedrooms, attic rooms and hidden stairways.  It is like stepping into a mixture of a haunted house, a museum and an antique shop.  His parents were both into archaeology, so have some amazing artifacts from all over the world.

Every room was full of books (including some Dickens first editions), old maps, pots, plates, paintings, you name it.  The more you looked, the more you saw.  Sorting through all of the stuff will take them months to complete.  You wouldn't want to just get rid of everything in one go - there are definitely items in there that are worth a lot of money.

Luckily, there are local museums and historical societies who will be happy to take some of the items, some of which (bags of skeletons) have already been delivered.  There is talk of the local town historical team coming in and spending a few days sorting through everything for them.  It would be a shame to get rid of it all in a skip or bonfire, although that could look like the easiest option.

My friend took us up to the attic room, where his Dad had his study and work room.  Apparently, some of it had been cleared away already, not that you could tell.

Makes you think, about what material belongings you might leave behind, that people have to sort through and dispose of.
