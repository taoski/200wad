I'm not sure if it is just a byproduct of getting older, but I find myself really feeling that impending sense of... death. I just can't seem to avoid it at the moment. The feeling creeps up on me every time I feel unwell, tired or have a strange ache I can't explain.

Sure, I ran 10k this morning in my second fastest time ever (without even pushing it too hard) but that strange pain I just got in my hip? Probably something fatal.

I think it is more a case of having low-level anxiety all of the time.

That feeling that something is wrong, my fight/flight/freeze responses kicking in, making my nerves jangle like a depressive spidey-sense crawling in my soul. Something just feels "off" or wrong that I can't explain. I feel like death is stalking me, constantly nagging that I am nearly 50 and could probably die any second. I guess we all could though.

My wife is very open about how she is feeling. She tells me when she feels ill, is in pain, is worrying about something or if a problem is bothering her.

For me, it is the opposite. She might complain about a niggly pain from a tight leg muscle after running, but I feel I am never able to share that I feel like I am about to die at any second several times a day. But is it real? Am I really feeling that that all of the time? Writing it here makes it sound worse than it probably is, but I am also good at disassociating from my problems too.

I just push those feelings away, down deep inside where they can't bother me. Besides, there is probably something I should be doing, including massaging away that muscle pain for my wife.

Physical problems are much easier to treat.
