My son has decided he needs a website now that he is doing music production and mixing for a few local bands and artists.

I am well versed in WordPress, so have offered to set one up for him, but it has given me an insight into what dealing with website clients must be like.

He only wants something simple, probably 5 pages at the most, but the first thing I did was to ask him to make a list of the pages he needed and to write down what will go on each page.  He made a small wire frame design and we talked about how it could be improved or tweaked.

I then explained a bit about WordPress and how the themes work, sending him off to google "WordPress themes for musicians" or "WordPress themes for music producers" to see what he can find that he liked the look of.  Not necessarily to use the theme in question (as most of them are premium paid themes) but just to get an idea of how it might look.  It is also a good opportunity to think about fonts and colors too.

That's one of the issues with WordPress.

Unless you are willing to pay for a theme and page builder like Elementor or Thrive, you kind of have to go with themes that are available and try to tweak them from there.  Of course, you may not quite end up with what you envision in your head.

This is where builders like Wix or Squarespace come in.  They lack a lot of things and are terrible for SEO, but are great to let people build what they can imagine.

WordPress is stuck between the two.  It offers great customization through themes and plugins, but you have to sign away a certain amount of control.

I will probably just find a basic theme and tweak the CSS myself to make it look good, using the built in WordPress Gutenberg blocks.  After all, he doesn't need anything complicated, so we don't need to go overboard.
