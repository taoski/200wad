Had a slow day today.  Running (slowly) to begin the day, followed by meandering food shopping.  After lunch my wife and I watched The Lost Boys, followed by not much else.  We got some washing done and had a roast dinner.  And that was pretty much it.

I looked at some stuff online about NodeJS after reading Bas talking/tweeting about it.  I downloaded some new books to my phone.  Now I have completed watching Parks and Recreation on Amazon, I need something else to do whilst I poop.

The books are Atomic Habits and Everybody Writes.  I will see how I get on with those.

I find choosing books hard work and get disappointed quickly.  Good job I torrent them all as ePUB copies.
