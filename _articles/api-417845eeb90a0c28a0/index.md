It is only 12 days until I need to find a working solution to replace the eBay Partner Network RSS feed they are decomissioning.  Without a replacement, some of my websites won't make any money from next month onwards.

To be honest, I don't really have the energy to look at it.

I would need to deobfuscate the plugin, check it works, replace the RSS feed functionality with the eBay Partner Network API, build in some error checking and fallback options and then roll it out to my live sites.

It's probably not as much work as I think as I have some saved functions that work with the API already, but it feels like a mountain to climb right now.  I suspect we will get to the end of the month and eBay will grant a stay of execution anyway, but I can't rely on that.

Of course, this would be an excellent time to come out with my own Wordpress plugin that would replace the existing one, but automatically convert to using the API.  It would mean that all people needed to do would be deactivate the old plugin and activate and configure the new one.

My "money making schemes" brain does not seem to be active at the moment.

Shame on me for not taking advantage of those people not fortunate enough to know how to code.
