It's a horrible feeling, not being able to help someone directly.

It looked like my wife might have trouble getting back from London today after several train problems all seemed to coincide near to the station she travels home from.

Not that there weren't other options, other routes, buses or underground trains to catch.  She likes to know her route and plan her outcome.  Deviating would mean her getting upset that she would be lost or would struggle.  But I know she would have been fine.

I started planning an alternative route, making some notes to send to her phone for when she came out of her last lecture.  We have traveled that route before but only once in 2 years, so the details might have been a little hazy.

But, as it turns out, the train problems appear to be getting fixed, lines unblocked and routes opened back up.  Her train home is back on time and everything should be fine for her.

I just don't like the feeling of not being there to help or calm her.  I know she would have been worrying despite the simple alternative route home.  Her wanting to plan and know her route should include at least one emergency alternative, but in the heat of the moment, being rational goes out of the window.

We had a similar situation with our Son a few weeks ago.  He was in London at a gig but was travelling back alone.  The trains were not quite as frequent as we thought (yes, stupid us and him for not checking) and he only had a small window of time to get back to the train station.

Luckily, he made it on to the train with a few minutes to spare and 1% battery left on his phone.  What would I have done if he had missed the train and run out of battery too?  I was preparing myself to drive to London to collect him but without the phone, how would he know that?
