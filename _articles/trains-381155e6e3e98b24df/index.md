Yay!  Another Coronavirus post!  There is no end of topics to write about these days.

Yesterday, we took a train to London to see my son play a gig.  I was in two minds of whether to go or not, knowing I would be jammed into a metal tube on wheels for at least an hour with all manner of different people.  We decided to go and I was not disappointed in my concerns.

Just outside London, the train stopped and quite a few people got on, including two guys who sat in the seats directly behind us.  As usual, I was being nosey, listening to them chatting about the bands they were going to see in the future and what was going on in their lives.

Then, one of them got a call from his wife.

”Ok, so I’ll just sleep on the sofa tonight.  Can you put out a few pillows for me and my dressing gown?  Thanks darling, see you tomorrow.”

He then proceed to quietly intimate to his mate that his wife was self-isolating, therefore he was also having to do the same from Monday.  He said all this in hushed voices too, adding to the obvious fact he was aware that him being on the train was a bad thing.

So, why the fuck was he on a train, sitting close to people, going to a gig where he would be in a crowd?

After our gig, we headed home and the train was more crowded.  I had to stand with my son, whilst my wife nabbed a seat.  An older couple stood near us and as people were getting on and squeezing in, they struck up a conversation with two younger women.  They shook hands, the older man seemed to be going in for hugs or putting his arm around the women all the time, to keep himself steady as the train rocked along.  They were talking about the virus but didn’t seem too concerned that they were breaking most of the social distancing rules we are supposed to be practising.

Then again, I also had to succumb to a few hugs, handshakes and fist bumps at our gig too.  It’s hard to stay cognisant of the rules 100% of the time, especially when you know the other people.

Its my wife’s birthday today too.  We have already said to my parents (both over 70)  that they shouldn’t come over because of our coughs and colds.  They are still deciding what to do and may come to drop off a card and gift at the doorstep instead.

I wonder if it will come to that over the next weeks and months?  Visiting my parents to drop off some supplies and having to stand away from them whilst they take them inside.

Strange and worrying times indeed.

I think I would rather have Brexit back again.  Oh no, wait - that is still happening anyway!
