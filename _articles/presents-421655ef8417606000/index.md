In a few days, it will be my 49th birthday.  I don’t really celebrate my birthday much, preferring a low-key day with nothing special happening.  I really hate being the centre of attention and would rather let it pass unnoticed, or wake up the next day only to realise I missed it.

Supposedly, I am difficult to buy presents for.  People always ask me what I want for my birthday or Christmas and my stock answer is either “Don’t know” or “nothing”.  This is also fact; I don’t know what I want, so nothing is fine.

I usually end up being given T-Shirts or cash, which ends up being spend on other people.  The cash my parents gave me for Christmas got spent by my wife as it was convenient to give it to her to pay for an appointment rather than have to go to the bank each week.  For fathers day, my Son’s gave me an Amazon voucher which has already disappeared on things that were not solely for me or chosen by me.

I always feel annoyed by the fact that people can’t buy presents for me.  I know I am not helping the situation by saying “nothing”, but I think that if they truly knew me or cared, they would know what to buy me.  Or is it that I am so boring that I have a very limited scope for being bought presents?  How can I know what I want if I don’t know myself?  And by that, I mean “know myself” - what or who I am.  That is the real reason I say “nothing”.  I still don’t know who I am, or how to enjoy myself.
