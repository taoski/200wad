Yesterday, I watched Have A Good Trip on Netflix, a documentary where celebrities share their tales of taking LSD, magic mushrooms and other psychedelic drugs.  It was not designed to dissuade you from taking it yourself, but did poke fun at the old trope of someone going mad whilst tripping, thinking they could fly and leaping out of a window.

It just reminded me of the 1980s.

I took my first LSD trip in 1989, the same summer I attended my first Glastonbury Festival, where I took my second.

My first tab, called a Laughing Buddha, was taken with friends on a summers day at a folk music festival in our town.  Perhaps 4 or 5 of us took one and freaked out for the afternoon.  As it was our first time, it felt quite strong and we probably looked like a dribbling mess to anyone else who saw us.  We even went to the pub for a pint but had to leave once we noticed each others faces were melting into the glasses.

One of our group left to walk in the fields and ended up communing with the cows and sheep, connecting with nature.  I can't remember exactly what we did that day.  I have vague memories of laughing uncontrollably, sitting on the grass at the festival.  I suspect we went walking, staring at the fractal clouds and trails coming from our hands.

At the end of the day, as the folk festival was wrapping up and I was on my way down, the stereoscopic sun was setting behind the convulsing trees and the organizers played the full Wish You Were Here album by Pink Floyd at full volume.  I just sat back and chilled the fuck out.

I took a much stronger trip at Glastonbury known as a Black Microdot.  As we were coming up on the LSD, my friends and I decided to try to find the car we came in just outside the perimeter.  We didn't get far and stumbled around in a field for too long.  My friends face was turning into a sneering demon and things were getting out of hand.  His girlfriend had never taken acid before, so was quite a mess.  We abandoned the idea and headed back towards the festival site.  The acid was really strong and it sent my two friends and I into a crazed MC Escher trip as we stumbled around in the darkness and craziness that is Glastonbury Festival at night, meeting strange characters and dancing to insane Dub Reggae.

I am really glad I took acid and did so several times afterwards, along with mushrooms when they were available.

However, I think I was one of the lucky ones.

I know people who have since had serious mental issues, been committed into care, taken their own lives or just dropped out.  LSD did change me and I sometimes wonder if I would be a different person now without those experiences and chemicals.  Did my years of drug taking lead to my depression, or was it always there in the background anyway, passed to me through genetics?  I guess I will never know.
