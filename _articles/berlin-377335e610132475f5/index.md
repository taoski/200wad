I was supposed to complete some work earlier today with my colleague in Berlin, but his office had been told to work from home for the next 4 weeks and to leave the office as soon as possible!

I am assuming this is related to Coronavirus and that either there was an infected person in their building or that they were just taking a common-sense approach and self-isolating until things calm down.

I will get some more information tomorrow but this was my first contact with someone who might be directly affected.  It does start to make you think about the work we do and how it could be completed from home.  Doing remote support is easy, building and shipping new servers, not so much.
