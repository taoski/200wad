My Son woke me up at 6 as his alarm went off and he stumbled to the shower to get ready for work.  I dozed until 7 AM and decided to get up.

I pulled my shorts and T-shirt on and opened the back doors, gathered the bags of recycling and rubbish and put them outside the back gate for the dustmen who come early on a Friday.  For a long time, I have called them "The Crashy Men".  
This is due to their love of violently tipping the glass recycling into the back of their truck with a total disregard for the time of day.

I left the doors open to let in some cool air, popped on an incense stick and a podcast and set about clearing the plates and cooking things into the dishwasher.  A job I had ignored last night.  Dried peas rattled into the bin and scrapings of dried vegetarian chili were flaked into a newly sheathed bin bag.

After the dishwasher was turned on, I set about cleaning the stove top and work surfaces, which took up another 20 minutes.  During this time I was also filling, emptying and refilling a water jug, prepping a new filter cartridge ready for my cup of tea later.

The podcast kept me entertained whilst I cleaned and tidied.  It helped distract me from what I was doing, the annoyance I felt for not doing this before I went to bed and that I probably had less sleep than I needed.  It helped that the podcast was funny too and it made me smile as the host and guest were laughing along, telling funny stories and sharing tales.

They were my morning friends, helping me get on, stopping me from slouching and scrolling through Reddit and Twitter.

Maybe tomorrow, after my morning run, I will try to do the same.  I hope I don't run out of podcasts to listen to.
