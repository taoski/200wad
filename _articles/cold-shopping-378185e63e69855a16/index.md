I don't get ill with colds that often, but when I do get it, I really get it.

Last night my head felt like a football, numb from being kicked around, full of dry mucus and weighing too much to keep it aloft my shoulders.  My colds always seem to attack my sinuses and ears too, making my eyes hurt, my head and cheeks hurt when I bend down and have a feeling like I am wearing a bondage collar around my neck (not that I know what that feels like... ;) ).

I felt better after a hot shower this morning and managed to get the food shopping done before lunch.  The shop was quite crowded and there were lots of people tutting and saying things to each other like "this is ridiculous..." or "this is so stupid..." when they discover there were only a few bags of Wholewheat Pasta left on the shelves and hardly any frozen pizza.

The shoppers gravitated from people clearly not giving a toss about our impending zombie contagion, to those filling their trolley as high as possible with nearly 4 of everything from the "bathroom" isle.  One lady had so many packets of tampons in her trolley, it was in danger of avalanching and trapping a small child against the remainder of the toilet rolls.  Perhaps she plans to eat them dipped in tomato sauce?

Despite my rational thinking that our situation is not as bad as it could be at the moment in the UK, I do become affected by slight panic.  I bought two packets of spaghetti "just in case" and started to think about how many meals I can squeeze from a single bag of potatoes and a tin of tuna.  And I don't like tuna :/

See you on the other side of armageddon folks!

I have watched The Walking Dead, so I will be one of the survivors.
