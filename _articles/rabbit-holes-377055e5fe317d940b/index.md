I realize that I am descending into writing about myself and my problems too much again here.  It was not my goal when I rejoined at all.

I wanted to write prophetic texts, convey new ideas, inspire people and be a better person.

Instead, I am going down the old rabbit hole of my depression, health issues and some dissatisfaction of where I have ended up in my life.  I guess that it is easier to write about yourself and what is going on rather than seek inspiration elsewhere.

It should be therapeutic, but often isn't.  I always hope that writing about what is going on with me will help put my thoughts and actions straight, but it doesn't.  Sometimes I can't even remember what I have written earlier that day.

I wonder if anything will ever change.  Will I still be sitting here in 12 months time going over the same things in my mind?  Or will nature take it's course and force something to happen?  I am sure that pain in my lower gut is not a strain from running too much.  Or is that just me thinking the worst again?  How far can I push it before something (literally) bursts or rots away?

Sometimes it is hard to know the difference and what is real and what I am imagining.  I astound myself constantly how I can compartmentalize problems into a "it's not real" box.  I can go from being convinced I am going to die from an illness one moment, to seeing the same scenario as a dream or story the next.

I wonder what people would think of me if I were gone.  Would I be seen as a good person?  Working hard and putting myself to one side for the needs of others?  Or would I be seen as a selfish martyr, putting my own health on the line for a short-term gain for others?  Would people feel guilty when they realized how they treated me and how hard this is?  I don't want people to feel bad but I suspect they would.

Perhaps my writing should be the truth for people to discover the real me.  But that was also a reason why I deleted my account previously: I was not being authentic or real, hiding behind my words and not sharing them with others.

Again, rabbit-holes, so sorry, kind reader.  Perhaps I just need a good long sleep to clear my head.
