It is now the second time I have written something and left it as draft.

I am too scared to publish it and will probably delete it soon.

The reason?  I am scared that someone from my family will read it.  I still keep writing here a secret, although I have left my browser window open enough times that someone might have taken a look out of interest.  I have even thought of a cover story.  I will say I helped write some code for the site or fix a problem for someone on Reddit.  Seems like something I might do.

When I deleted my old 200WaD profile, it was because I felt I was not being authentic.  I am hiding behind @Twizzle, writing of my bad feelings, frustrating and unfulfilling life and not expressing it to anyone (apart from my distant friends on WhatsApp, which is not much different from writing here).

Why do I feel so scared to be myself?

Even worse, in my own house, marriage and family?

I was thinking about it earlier whilst I stared out of the window at the cloudless sky.  What is stopping me from telling my wife I write each day?  Am I scared of her reading what I am writing?  Probably.  But that also means I am either scared of her, or scared of her reading what I write.  I would be happy for her to read if I was writing about WordPress all the time though (despite her never reading any of my websites I have created over the years).  It is obviously the expression of my feelings I struggle with, especially to her.

More thinking needed.
