When I caught the train back home from London yesterday, it was carnage on the rails.  A train had managed to pull down nearly 1 KM of power lines which was affecting a lot of trains with many services cancelled or delayed.

Luckily, our train was on time and we managed to judge the correct platform it would depart from (out of 18 possible options) and ran to get a seat before the masses cottoned on where they needed to go.

When we sat down there were 2 women sitting to the side of us, together side-by-side, sharing a table seat.  As the train started to fill up with passengers, a guy was talking to them, saying that he had pre-booked one of the seats they were using,  He wasn’t being too aggressive, but in the end, it was clear that the train the two 2 ladies were supposed to be on was a slightly later one that had been cancelled.  They were advised to catch this earlier train by the station staff.  And I guess they expected that the seats they had reserved on a different train at a different time, transferred with them.

Most UK trains have a small LCD display above the seats showing if they are reserved, but nothing was showing on any of them in this carriage.

The guy was not travelling as far as them and they all decided to wait until the guard came to resolve the issue.  But the guard never arrived and the ladies refused to move.  The train left the station and after another 5 minutes, the guy asked the women if he could have his seat and one of them agreed and stood next to me in the isle.

This is not an uncommon situation if you have ever pre-booked a seat on a train in the UK.  I commuted by train for 5 years and have seen it all, from tears to fights, shouting and aggression.  I never choose to book a seat, even though it is free.  I know what it can lead to.  Perhaps I might if I was travelling a very long distance, but for a short commuter trip, it is not worth the hassle.

The problem was that I was now agonising with myself if I should be offering this lady my seat.  It was her fault that she had (unknowingly) taken this guys seat, but now she had to stand until either I got off at the next stop (30 minutes away) or someone offered her a seat.  My wife, who had consumed 2 glasses of wine by now snuggled against me and closed her eyes.  I couldn’t imagine moving now, but it didn’t stop my guilt.

It could have been easily remedied.  As the guy was initially arguing with them, there were still plenty of seats free.  He could have quite easily just accepted the situation and sat somewhere else (but without a table).  Once he did get his seat, he just sat dicking around on his phone anyway.  It wasn’t as if he needed to sit and work with his laptop.  By that time, there were no other free seats so the lady had to stand.

Perhaps it is just my good nature that was piqued, seeing the wrong outcome in this situation.  Sure, you should get what is rightfully “yours” and be assertive, but he didn’t need that specific seat, any one would have done for his 30 minute journey.  The 2 ladies should have also been more accepting that it was their issue, not his.  It was clear from their tickets that they were incorrectly claiming the seats as theirs.  I probably should have stood up for her to have my seat and would have if I was not with my wife.  It’s not as if I can’t stand for 30 minutes (as I had to do on the way to London that same day).
