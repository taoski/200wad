My son nearly fainted today.

The best part of that story was, that we were at hospital at the time.

He was getting an x-ray, felt funny and went grey and nearly passed out.

It was probably the best place to be.

He was quickly moved on to a trolley, taken to a side-ward, had his blood pressure taken several times, blood sugar levels checked and they even gave him 2 chocolate biscuits. He was fine after 20 minutes or so and was able to finish the x-ray session, see the consultant and grab a KFC on the way home.

It was also one of those odd situations for me. I am quite calm under pressure, probably too much so and when I was called into the x-ray room, he looked awful, collapsed on a chair with several nurses around him. I think I tend to revert to "robot mode" and become very logical, thankful to everyone and practical, carrying his clothes, helping open doors for the trolley and not being a nuisance to anyone, declining the use of a chair several times. I know other parents would probably be really worried, crying, panicking or causing a scene.

I can never be sure if this is the right way to behave.

I didn't rush in to the x-ray room and grab his hand, or show any emotion. I just see the facts as they are and determine what to do next. He wasn't at death's door, just suffering from low blood pressure. Funny turns like these happen to us all, at times.

Perhaps I was in some sort of shock: my fight, flight, freeze, fawn had kicked in and I just stood there letting them get on with it. Or perhaps I am just not remembering it right. Was I more engaged with the situation? Did I show concern, even just in my voice behind my face-mask?

I can't be sure.

But it worries me how I am, appear to be, or how I remember myself being in those sorts of situations.
