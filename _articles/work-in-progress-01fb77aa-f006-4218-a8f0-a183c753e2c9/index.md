I am fifty.

My friends are all semi-digital now.

Hilarious pints of ale by autumn pub fires have been replaced by notifications, ignored links, memes and pictures of children I have never met.

We swap memories or music and remember feelings of the times that were important to us all. We all have regrets of paths taken or avoided, mistakes we shun from our minds, close shaves and escapes of relationships we savour or regret and there might be the odd achievement, but we still revel in the banter of self-ridicule. Taking the piss out of each other is our currency and no-one is left short-changed.

We are fifty, starting to sag whilst trying to right physical and mental wrongdoings, becoming holier than thou. Do as I say, not as I did. We had drugs, books and music when we were young, when our future was a dream we needed to escape. We survived the 90's and brandish our redundancy payments, mortgages, struggling children, sexless marriages and work laptops as our badges of honour. Upgrading our broadband is as good as it gets. Our dreams of what we could have been are many, frequent and sometimes painful. We haven't mastered the ability to practice gratitude.
