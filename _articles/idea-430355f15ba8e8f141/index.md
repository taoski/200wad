I had an idea the other day.

The UK government recently started a new Brexit publicity campaign called "[Check Change Go](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-new-campaign-to-prepare-uk-for-end-of-the-transition-period)".  The idea is that if you are a UK business, you need to check your operating procedures, adjust or change what you do and go forward to the great beyond.

Of course, this being the latest 3-word catchy campaign from the UK government, it has lead to some "piss taking" online.

My idea was to create a website that automatically generates these campaign adverts from a list of random words.  The words would then be assembled on top of a stock image and turned into a picture that could be downloaded or shared.  I thought it might end up being quite good fun, especially on social media.

And there my idea stopped.

Aha!  I thought.  Time to get a Netlify or Carrd site and create something quick and dirty.  I mean... how hard can it be:

> Create an array of words, choose 3 randomly, position them on the screen on top of an image chosen at random.  Done.

But hmmm - I only really know PHP code, so would have to work using that.  And, would be better to buy a domain and host the site myself, rather than relying on a free hosting platform where I might have to pay if it suddenly takes off?

I have build images with PHP before, but that was in 2006!  How do I do that again?  
There must be a better way of doing it by now?  CSS, Jquery, Rails?  Shit... too many options to choose from.  Not sure where to start looking.

Or, it sounds like a perfect little #nocode project to have some fun with, but where do I start?  Which service is best to use?  Perhaps I could reach out to some of the #nocode guru's on here and ask?  Ah... never mind.  Too much effort.

And there we have it, the rise and fall of an idea in about 60 minutes.

Where did all my enthusiasm go?
