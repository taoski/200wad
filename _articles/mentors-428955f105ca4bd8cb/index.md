I was thinking about my son again yesterday, wondering how to get him to switch his mindset towards getting a job, or at least starting some sort of "work" from home.  With Coronavirus wiping out many jobs, the possibility of him picking up work is looking slim for the next few months at least.  He also is not sure where his life is leading either.  He is not driven towards any specific career or goal.  He's a bit like I was after school, just drifting from one thing to the next, without a real plan.

I suspect that if I tried to mentor him, or tried to instill some sort of work ethic or direction, he would immediately discount it.  Sometimes, words of encouragement don't work when they come from those closest to you.  He has never been a child who liked praise, often getting annoyed if we cheered when he did well on a school test or did something well.

I wonder how easy it is to find a good "mentor" or "role model" these days?

There are so many people online who people follow, hanging on every social media post and picture, despite the fact that they only show the perspective they want you to see.  For every inspirational Instagram post, there could be a thousand where the subject is just pooping or eating noodles, like the rest of us plebs.  How can you cut through the bullshit that is out there and find someone who is more genuine?

I have fallen for a few "gurus" over the years, some more authentic than the rest.  

**Gary Vaynerchuck** spouts truth at you 24/7, that you should be hustling, DM'ing people, making connections and working hard.  But his enthusiasm and tough love can be a turn off after a while, especially if, like me you struggle with taking action.

**Tony Robbins** seems like an authentic guy and I like a lot of what he says and does.  He is also someone who seems able to encourage you to live a better life but the fact that he does his mega-church-like seminars, puts me off.  He is obviously making serious money and living a good life, but it sometimes feels a little too over the top.

**Tim Ferriss** is another quirky, interesting character, taking time to experiment, taking in art and writing whilst also trying to be the best person he can, in life and in business.  His books and podcasts are inspirational, but hard to implement, unless you have something to fall back on.  He feels like he is playing at life and has a content soul.

**Pat Flynn** is a rags-to-riches kind of guy.  He lost his job as an architect, but was able to start an online business from a single website selling test exams. He then pivoted to teaching people how to do the same, often learning himself as he went.  He also seems like a genuine guy, humble, family oriented and willing to share everything with others.

They have all come and gone in varying amounts during the last 13 years.  When I need a kick up the butt, Gary is there to enthuse me.  Tony and Tim making me think about my life, who I am, where I am, what I want and can I afford it?  Pat is the warm, homely reminder that, like him, I can start with nothing and achieve a lot in my life and business.

I wonder if young people have access to "proper" mentors any more?
