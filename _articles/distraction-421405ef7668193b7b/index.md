I am sitting here, trying to write whilst my wife watches television.  I am finding it hard to focus, my attention is being dragged to the glowing screen to my left.

I like some quiet whilst I am writing or creating something.  Words can be distracting, although I can quite happily work in a coffee shop without too much interruption to my flow.

I could put on my headphone and play some music or white noise to drown out the television, but don’t want to draw too much attention to what I am doing.  Despite me sitting near to her, she doesn’t know what I am doing.  If she asks, I will pretend I am writing a message on Slack about some code I am working on.

It’s a silly existence really.
