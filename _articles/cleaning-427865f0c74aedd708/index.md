My post from the other day, about doing something first thing in the morning, like cleaning the cooker hob, to help you achieve more didn't last long.

I was up just after 6 AM today, ran 5 kilometres and then sat in the armchair, drinking tea and scrolling through Reddit and Twitter.  I could have emptied the dishwasher or cleaned the kitchen, but I didn't even remember it was a thing I should be doing.  The Internet won this morning.

As I write this, I am sitting in my kitchen.  To my left on the worktop is a chopping board covered in the remains of some salad I made for my wife's lunch.  Tops of radishes and sweet peppers, red onion skin and those bits of a spring onion I am never sure if you are supposed to eat or not.

Surrounding them are the piles of plates that were used at lunch time, knives, forks, spoons, a few cups, some yogurt pots and a bowl where the teabags go.  To the left of that sits the hob, adorned with the frying pan I used last night to cook steaks in.  I never cleaned it as it wouldn't fit in the dishwasher, so I filled it with soapy water and left it overnight to soak.  

Putting things in soak is the lazy mans way of saying he has done the washing up.

Keep moving left and you come across some baking trays, used to oven-cook vegeburgers last night and cheese on toast yesterday lunchtime.  These were also too much to fit in the dishwasher, so got left out overnight.  No doubt I will need one of them when I cook later, and will be annoyed it is not clean.

Most days, I am just too tired to do it all.

I cooked last night, the same as every night for as far back as I can remember.  
I can't do everything.

Last night, after we ate, I left the plates on the table until I went to bed at 11 PM.  No-one else cleans away apart from me, so I always have to remind myself "I might as well do it now, on my way to bed, rather than come down to a table full of dirty plates in the morning."  So I put as much as I could into the dishwasher and left the rest on the side, thinking I would deal with them in the morning.

It didn't happen.
