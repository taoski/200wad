I always get sucked into these things.

First it was the missing MH370 flight, then Pizzagate, then if Julian Assange was missing, Brexit, Trump and now the Coronavirus!

I know I need to remain rational and be a sensible human being, but it is hard not to be caught up in the media circus and spiraling Reddit threads.

It ends up being hard to determine what is real and what is just sensationalist news, spread by people who just want attention or have heard a rumor from a friend-of-a-friend.

I even lay awake in bed last night, listening to my son cough now and again from a few rooms away.  He had been to a few concerts over the last few weeks, so my mind was in overdrive about the possibility that he had caught something.

Today, I can't seem to stop reloading Reddit and BBC News to find out the latest.  The TV is on in the other room and I can make out the odd bulletin about the spread of the virus.  In one report they are saying schools and businesses are closing and gatherings are being cancelled.  Then you read on Reddit that massive festivals in Spain and Germany are still going ahead despite them being close to the areas where people are affected.

It is all doom and gloom and I just can't pull myself away from it.

I did buy 2 packs of toilet-roll though this weekend, just in case.
