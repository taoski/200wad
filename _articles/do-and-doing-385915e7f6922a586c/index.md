After reading about @jasonleow and his [WAMZStack](https://cowriters.app/words/the-tech-stack-for-nocode-the-wamzstack-382745e74341a2b594) idea, I delved down into the Webflow hole.  I had heard of it before, but never really appreciated what it was or what it could accomplish.

I followed the recommended [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPINPbP6y06tcLY_rZLi8euf) Jason had linked for me and also watched a few more videos too.  I wanted to get a sense of what it was all about and how the editor operated.

I then joined a Webflow Designers Facebook page and have been following along, looking at the examples people have shared, their tips, tricks and ideas.  I like it when I see people asking what look like complicated questions, only to be directed to a simple tutorial or button.

I thought about my friend who still builds HTML and CSS sites but "Doesn't do mobile" as I learned about tweaking the CSS for different mobile break-points.  It all looks so simple.  I immediately went to my "[future mode](https://cowriters.app/words/future-mode-382855e749d293aa81)" brain, thinking of how I could help him use it as his development tool rather than helping him learn WordPress.

So why haven't I signed up for Webflow yet?

Let's rewind a few years.  Well... quite a few years to before I was a teenager in the 1980s.

I will use an example of the original [Warhammer Fantasy Battle](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4192/warhammer-mass-combat-fantasy-roleplaying-game-1st) game, which came out in 1983.  It was the first large consumer wargames rule set (before all that 40k crap).  I suspect the rulebook was around £10 when it first came out, which, back then, was quite a lot of money.  You also had to buy the figures and paint them too, don't forget.

I was in two minds of whether to buy the game or not and spent a long time in the toy shop reading the book whenever I got a chance.  By the time I did have enough money to buy it, I was familiar with the game, but had never actually played it.  I had also read a lot about it in the monthly White Dwarf magazine, so knew how it all worked on a simple level.

I got the book home and then didn't really do much with it.  Sure, I tried a few games with my friends, but the initial enthusiasm wained quickly once I owned it.  Perhaps it was the realisation that I had to actually DO something to move forward, not just read and understand it.  That was not enough for it to be fulfilling.

In the end, I returned it to the shop and got a refund saying it had been too difficult for me to play.

I seemed to have lost the joy of discovery of learning the game through playing and experiencing it which I had done with other games prior to that.

So, back to Webflow.

I am in a similar situation.  I have spent a week researching and experiencing it which feels like too long to be able to get anything out of signing up.  Having a thirst for knowledge is a good thing, but is it if it is at the expense of DOING?

Perhaps if I had lots of friends who wanted to play Warhammer in the 80s and invest in armies of figures and weekends spent building landscapes, that would have been better?  Maybe if I had a website in mind to design using Webflow, it might spur me on to do something more than watch and absorb from the periphery.

Am I getting the same buzz from watching people DO that I might have previously gotten from DOING?

_Re-reading this before I published shows a clear pattern between Warhammer and Webflow.  They are both just tools.  The real achievement is using them to create or make something.  On their own, they are amazing, but useless unless you use them.  I am the in the same situation with my iPad Pro and Procreate too.  I obsessed about getting them for years but now I have them, I feel I can't put the work in to make anything._

I know I have read about some research outlining how watching people play video games like Minecraft or Apex Legends can be as mentally stimulating and rewarding as playing it yourself (not that I can find the damn article again).  Is that what I am doing?  Is learning about something and being a passive member of the community as far as I will go?  Is that rewarding enough?

How do I break that cycle?
