I am feeling weary today.

I got up early just after 7 AM and ran 7 kilometres.  I had breakfast and a quick shower and then headed off to meet some friends for a walk and a coffee.  We were back home by 11 AM.

Since then, I have been feeling sleepy.  Perhaps the days and nights are just catching up with me, or the impact of the recent heat we have been having in the UK has finally gotten to me.  I feel like I could doze off on the sofa if I wanted to.

But, its a Sunday, so not a problem - there is not much else to do.
