2020 is fast lining up to be “The Year Of The Wrap”.

For some reason, I picked up a pack of 8 flour wraps at the supermarket one week.  I just thought it might make lunchtime more interesting, mix things up a little and give the kids something else to eat other than ham sandwiches.

That was 5 months ago and I have been buying them every week since, save the odd divergence to pitta bread.

They are a good bread substitute and are not so stodgy to eat.  They usually also contain a health amount of salad too, which is useful for our diets.  Cook up a spicy bean burger too and you have a nice meal!

I wonder what the next food fad will be for us?
