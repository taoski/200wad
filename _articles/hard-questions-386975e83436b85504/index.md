**If you had $1000 of extra month income today, how would that change your life?**

Having this extra money would take away some financial insecurity and make me feel more settled.  I would be able to save, plan more for the future and enjoy a few extras in my life and not feel guilty.

I have been in this situation before (for realsies!) but frittered away the money without thinking.

**If you had $10000 of extra month income today, how would that change your life?**

I would be able to give up my day job if I wanted to and concentrate on making my own decisions about how to live.  I would be able to move house which would help keep my family happy and afford things I wanted.  I could also use the extra money to help others somehow - I don't really need an additional $10k per month (depending on how expensive the new house is)!

**If you earned a million dollars a year just from interest on investments, what would your life look like?**

 I could travel, not that I am really a travelling type, but would like to experience living in new places without the worry of having to stay somewhere shitty.  If I still needed to work, I could do so from anywhere in the world.  I could become a philanthropist and help others with my money.  I would have freedom to choose my life, somewhat like Hollywood stars seem to be able to do.  I would not worry about money or the future.  I see Jim Carey like that.  He is successful and probably has no worries about money, now spends most of his time painting.  He has a choice when he wakes up what he wants to do with his day.

**Let's say you have the 1 million dollars of passive income coming in each year, how would you spend your time? (design your dream day)**

I would like to be able to take my time over breakfast, tea or coffee in my home or perhaps in a studio apartment in a major city somewhere.  I would exercise and have coffee in a coffee shop somewhere nearby.  My day consists of being creative, artistic or somehow helping others.  Maybe I am painting or writing.  To not have to worry about where my next money was coming from would feel like total freedom.  Perhaps I would be starting a young entrepreneur school helping school kids make money online, or helping house homeless people, giving them a break for a change.  Or perhaps I would be writing a novel or non-fiction book.  I would want to go to bed knowing I had lived a good day and that I had no regrets for doing or not doing something.

**If you had all the money that you needed for the rest of your life, what would you spend the next three years doing?**

I would have to help people with their lives.  I am not sure if this is best done by giving people handouts when they need it or helping to give them the skills and tools to create a better life for themselves.  Some people need immediate help, housing, food, water, healthcare.  Others need some mentoring to be able to move forward.
