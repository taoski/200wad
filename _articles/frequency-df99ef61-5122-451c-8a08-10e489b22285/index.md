I started listening to a podcast about poetry recently.

I think I must have started it once before, but didn't get on well with it, but thought I would give it another try. Sometimes, when I am waiting for a new episode of podcasts I subscribe to, I need a "filler" and this hit the spot.

I have never really been into poetry before. I must have covered it at school, as part of our English Language or Literature lessons, but I don't really recall. All I remember is saying to my teacher that "maybe the poet just wrote it... he didn't really mean to convey some other meaning!" To which I was shot down immediately, not that I cared.

Sometimes, in my head, I reach a "frequency" where my thoughts and words can sound like poetry. I am able to cast eloquent sentences, word play and rhythm that I could never write. I come close sometimes, but never quite reach what is in my head. I imagine being a poet is like being in that frequency at all times. It is a little like when I was obsessed with photography, where I was able to see everything with a "photographers eye". My days were consumed with a passion for making or taking the next great photo. Perhaps being a writer, artist or poet is like living like that all of the time. Everything becomes art and poetry. You are able to see things on a different level, seeing meaning, relevance, beauty, contrast and metaphor more easily.

I wonder how to reach that frequency?
