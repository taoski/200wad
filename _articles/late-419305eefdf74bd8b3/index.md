I'm running out of time to write something today.  So I will settle for a quick blurb.

I feel rough this evening.  Probably something I have eaten.  Either that, or I am having an anxiety attack.  Possibly a combination of both.

I should probably try to sleep after taking an antiacid tablet or three.

I thought it would be my wife who fell after finishing her dissertation.  But it looks like it might be me this time.

\====

Update: I felt ok after a while.  I think it was a small case of indigestion that was causing my discomfort.  By the time I was in bed, I felt much better.

I am struggling to find the time to write at the weekend and keep it secret and secure from everyone else.  I am not ready to share this with anyone still, I like to keep it for myself.  I am sure I have written things here that will piss people off or upset them.  How can I be truly free to write if I am worried about what I am saying?

I thought writing here would give me some freedom, but in another way, it has just created a new cage for me.
