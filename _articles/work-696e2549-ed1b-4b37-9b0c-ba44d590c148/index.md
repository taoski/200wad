It's only 3 PM but feels like it has been a hectic work day already.

Still 3 hours to go before I can knock off.

Today was the start of a new project driven by our main customer. We did the pilot activity together and they have pushed ahead with the rest of the work, but we haven't yet been contacted to test what they have implemented. I am not even sure if the call will come or not.

I will just carry on doing other stuff until they ask me to check things.

Perhaps they won't even call?

To add to that, today I should be preparing my billing spreadsheets to bill our customers. But, the network drive where our files were located went offline at about 10 AM. It came back up again, but no files are there any more! Seeing as the server is located somewhere in Europe, I have no idea if it died and is being restored, or perhaps it was decommissioned and no-one told me.

I logged a ticket about it to our internal service desk, who are fairly useless. They insisted I rebooted my laptop as it might fix the issue, despite me proving to them whilst they remotely controlled my screen, that the server was online, but the file shares were missing. It's funny how often a service desk in an IT company disputes the technical skills of the person logging the issue.

The phone doesn't seem to stop ringing, emails are arriving, instant messages are pinging.

I need a holiday.
