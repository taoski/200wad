I have hardly accomplished anything today.

Weekends are supposed to be for getting shit done around the house, doing DIY or chores.  Well, thats how we have been brought up.

I knew it was going to be got today (for the UK) so I went for a short run with my wife and one of our friends.  We were back home just after 10 AM, time for a quick cuppa and then out to do the weekly food shop.

After lunch, we both just sat.  My wife has been binge-watching the "Line of Duty" TV series and I just scrolled aimlessly on my phone, snacking when ever I got bored.

By 4 PM, I was starting to drop off to sleep.  The snooker was on the TV (which I like) but it kept morphing into strange dreams as my eyes closed.

Soon it will be time to cook dinner, so that will give me something to do.  Perhaps we might go for a walk once it has cooled down too, but most likely will just crash in front of the TV.

There were plenty of things I could have done, but I guess I need downtime too.
