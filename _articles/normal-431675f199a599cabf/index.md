I often catch myself wondering "is this normal?"

My wife had a very minor health scare over the last few days.  It was pretty obvious that it wasn't anything too worrying, but it still didn't stop me from having a consultation with Dr Google.  Of course, he confirmed my worst fears: she would probably implode at any moment unless urgent medical assistance was found.

But before I Googled her symptoms, a cloud of anxiety fell over me.  I found that I was clenching my jaw, wincing visibly at the thought of hospital procedures and possible outcomes and had a feeling that I wanted to punch a door to let my feelings out.

But is that normal?

Of course, I love my wife and don't want anything bad to happen to her or any of my friends and family.  But what I realized is that I feel like that quite a lot.  Especially the teeth clenching, door punching part.  Perhaps I have general low-level anxiety?

Often, when I am laying in bed, the anxiety comes on for no reason, like a million pound weight duvet, crushing the wind out of me.  I find myself laying there, gritting my teeth and pulling on my hair, body tensed like a spring, not ready to sleep at all.

As I sit on the bed and write this (I have been booted out from the kitchen as my wife is on a Skype call with someone) I feel physically tense.  After my run earlier this morning, I have had a slight fluttering in a part of my chest.  Not my heart, but most likely a little muscle spasm between my ribs.  But, as a result, I am holding that side of my body in tension, leading to an aching shoulder and uncomfortable feeling.  The anxiety is always there.

It is always in the back of my mind that just before my Father had a heart attack about 14 years ago, he said he noticed a funny taste in his mouth just before he didn't remember any more.  He woke up in hospital with a stent and and gratitude he lives next to a Paramedic who happened to be in that day when my Mother ran to get help.  Not that he is unhealthy at all, it was just a rogue piece of fat that got stuck in his vegetarian arteries somewhere.

But with my little muscle spasm/flutter, I am also on the lookout for strange tastes.  I keep gulping, swallowing and clacking my tongue to see if it is just something stuck at the back of my teeth, or an impending cardio vascular event.

But is is normal to feel like this all the time?

Or is it my "new normal"?
