At present, I am hosting 7 WordPress websites on my VPS server.

When I started using it, I was building hundreds or thousands of spam sites a month, which meant I needed a big beast to keep up.  But those times have gone and I am left paying $69 per month, which I am barely making back with affiliate income now.

So, I decided it was time to downgrade.  No time like the present to look at your finances and have companies bend over backwards to keep you.

The new VPS will come without any managed services (my choice) and I will opt for using VestaCP rather than Cpanel to keep the costs down.  I am sure the existing VPS doesn't have any "managed services" either, like someone to update the OS and check for issues - maybe that was included in the original price?

For the same hardware spec, the cost will drop to $8.99 a month.  This dramatic drop in price is because my original provider was bought out by another, who now offer cheaper solutions.  Or perhaps $69 was the going rate for a VPS back in 2011?  I did have shared hosting at the same time for a few years too, but cancelled that a while ago, migrating everything to the VPS.  It does amaze me, that like other utilities, I have just been paying $69 per month for ages without investigating possible savings.

Of course, I will have to manually migrate the sites myself, but this looks pretty straight forward and I can test on a low-traffic site to make sure I can document what needs to be completed each time.  By the time I will have completed the last one, I will be an expert!

Back up the files and databases, wget them to the new VPS and unzip and import.  What could go wrong? :)

Last night when I was exchanging emails with the sales team I did consider just deleting or selling all of my sites and cancelling the whole VPS.  I am not getting any fulfillment from writing new content for a long time now, but I may get the urge again.

I am also stupidly hosting a Wordpress site for a paid WordPress plugin I created and for someone I did some IT work for back in 2010.  He has had free hosting from me for about 10 years!  What a numpty I am :)
