After she finished her University course, we went through "The Crash" where my wife felt tired all the time.  She was glued to the sofa, wondering why she wanted to go back to sleep all the time.

After "The Crash" comes "The Tidy" where she starts to notice things around the house that have gone untouched for years.

"Oh.. that is broken, we need to fix that."

"We need to tidy the garden, lets go buy some new plants."

"Perhaps we need to paint the bedroom. Its looking tired."

"How long has that crack been there?"

"I'm sure it wasn't like that before." (meaning 5 years ago)

I find this phase quite annoying.  Not just because it means I have to do DIY type stuff, which I don't really enjoy, but because I feel aggrieved that she is noticing these things.  It's true, the house looks like it could do with some upkeep, but it has been rolling along quite nicely for years, whilst her attention has been on other things.

But, I know this is my issue.  It makes me feel guilty that I haven't been doing things, like a "real man" should.  What have I been doing with the last 2 years of my life?
