I received an IT support request from someone I used to help out years ago and still manage her website content for her.  She had some issues and wanted my advice.

All good, no problem.

Then, because it was a Microsoft issue, she started to blame Bill Gates, went off on a tangent about him microchipping people and forcing vaccines on them.  Plus, did I know how many people in India had been killed by his vaccines?

I didn't reply.  There is no arguing with that level of stupid.

In the end, I just said "Bill Gates doesn't work for Microsoft any more, he is funding research into beating Malaria and things like that.  I think he is actually one of the good guys!"

She ignored me and continued.

"The word on the street is that Bill Gates and Dr Faucci created the Coronavirus and when it was banned in the US, they sent it to Wuhan."

"There is so much coming out about the Deep State and they're self-serving.  And Soros is funding all of these protests!"

"I certainly won't have a vaccine against the virus!  They just need to encourage people to have a healthy lifestyle and improve their immune systems."

Again, I didn't reply.

I wanted to scream, shout and say something so cutting it would mute her stupidity forever.  But I just let it go and changed the subject.  She was on Dubai time and it was too early in the UK for getting into silly arguments.

Another one of my friends also posted something to her Facebook this morning exclaiming how bad these (UK) riots were and that the police need funding, more officers recruiting, better respect and support.

I wanted to reply that perhaps she shouldn't repeatedly vote for a government party who has consistently defunded the police, health services, local councils and schools.

It wasn't long ago she was posting cheery messages that Boris Johnson had won a majority in our government.  I didn't have the heart to remind her that when she posted her "support the NHS and improve pay for our nurses" poster during the peak of the virus, that Boris and his colleagues all back-slapped and cheered each other in parliament when they voted down a bill that proposed higher wages for health worker staff.

I don't really know enough about politics to argue my point with people though, but since Brexit all kicked off, I do try to keep abreast of what is going on.  It is obvious to see the lies, skullduggery, double standards and nepotism in government.  And don't get me wrong, it is the same on both sides of the government - they are all as bad as each other.

But, people will believe whatever they quickly repost on Facebook without thinking.
