I feel like I am dying today.

I can't tell if my aching, lower back pain is from running and sitting too much, or a dark illness, eating away at my insides. My balls ache, my hips hurt and I feel fuzzy and prickly, like I am running a slight temperature. My thermometer says otherwise, though. I can't seem to shake this cold, which I feel like I have had for months now and I just feel exhausted all of the time. I am not sleeping well either, waking up at random times, not able to get back to sleep. I have a ball of rage in my stomach which gets triggered by loud noises or the notification of a new email. I feel like I want to punch something, probably myself in the face.

I watched a brief news report about "burn out" yesterday. It described what happens when you work too much, the illnesses you can get and how it makes you feel. Despite the lock downs we have had in the UK over the last year, I have only had 2 days off from work. Those 28 days I didn't take evaporate at 23:59 on new years eve. With everything that has been going on, work has been a constant, even whilst businesses have been closed.
