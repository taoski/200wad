Our new neighbors are moving in today.  I heard a few bumps and bangs from next door and spotted a hipster unloading his BMX from his car.

My wife and I did some initial surveillance and in the end I decided to go out and say hello, offering to make a coffee if they couldn't find their kettle.  I have only spoken to the guy so far, but he seems really nice.

My wife and I are both quite shy and would generally not introduce ourselves, but we thought that it would be a good idea, seeing as we haven't done so to most of our other neighbors over the years.  Sometimes us breaking the ice is best, rather than waiting indefinitely for the perfect moment to say hello.

He seemed really excited to be moving to our town, coming from another part of our city which is quite rural and does not have much of a night life, unless you count drinking warm, frothy ale with farmers a good night out.

They have already fallen foul of the bad parking in our terraced road and are lugging their belongings through the back gate.  I would offer to help, but social distancing, and all that :)

Hopefully, we can be good acquaintances.  Not friends, they look half my age, but as long as we are all nice to each other, all will be well.
