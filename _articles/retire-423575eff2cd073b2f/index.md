The thought of retirement scares me.  Not because I will old that much older, that I won't have anything to "do" to keep me occupied.  Whilst my mind in unoccupied by work, the depression devil creeps in, causing havoc.

I would hope that I will have some financial security by then so that I didn't have to work unless I really wanted to.  It would be the routine that I would miss most, but it might give me time to explore other things.

And that's where the rub is.

Why am I waiting to retire to be able to do more things?  I think it was Tim Ferris who made me aware of the stupid idea that you work all of your life to retire and do  the things you really want to, when you are least able to do them.  Who knows, we might not even make it to retirement age at all.  Tim proposes you take "mini retirements" throughout your working life.  This will help you achieve some of your wants and goals, whilst you can see well enough to enjoy them.

I once worked with someone who retired, found out he had cancer a week after and then died a month later.  He had dreams of going sailing and spending time reading.  He just worked himself to death instead.

My vision is that I will still be able to build websites that make me money.  I should hopefully have more time to spend on it and the tasks will help keep me mentally fit.

The truth will most likely be that my wife will still be working as a child counselor and I will be driving her around.  On the days she is not working, the grandchildren will be here, so I will get nothing done.

Is that a bad thing?

I guess we will find out.
