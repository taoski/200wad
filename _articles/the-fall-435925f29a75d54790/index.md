My wife has started to come down from her "high" of working on her masters degree.

She claimed that at 11 AM, she could quite happily go back to bed.  The constant need to be doing something, thinking about her work, writing, planning, researching or reading has come to an end and has left her in a bit of a void.

To my mind, this is the perfect time to keep busy.  Get back out running, create her business and website, plan for returning to her placements in September and go from there.

But the tiredness will take over and pin her to the sofa.

I will have to keep an eye on her, in case she slips into a slight depression.
