Wow.  It's Friday again already.

Soon, my wife will be calling for me to scurry to the shops to buy her a bottle of white wine.  Either that, or it will be time for her "special drink" (JD and Coke).  

But she deserves it this week.  I will forego the chastising comments, jokingly accusing her of "weekend binge drinking".  Besides, her drinking weekend normally starts on a Thursday, so I can't quite justify the ribbing.

Her dissertation is taking shape, but the collateral damage is that her shoulder, neck and arm are in agony.  She broke her arm 5 years ago and, due to nerve damage and a shitty surgeon, it has never quite been the same.

She can only stand typing or working for a certain amount of time before it starts to lock up, her muscles compress the scar tissues in her elbow, pinching the nerves which cause burning pain or numbness.

I am usually called to perform back, shoulder, arm and hand massage when it gets really bad.  The cooler, wetter weather also doesn't help.  Her body has become a barometer.

I am thinking about varnishing and mounting her on the wall so I know if I need an umbrella when I pop to get her that wine.
