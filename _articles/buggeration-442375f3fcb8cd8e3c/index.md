Twizzle awoke early.  The cockerels were crowing, the sheep were bleating and the local drunkard was still puking in the gutter.  All was well with the world as the sun rose on yet another weekday.

He popped on his dressing gown and stumbled down the stairs, yawning and smacking his lips.  As was with the Royal British Morning Cup of Tea Ritual, he went straight to the kettle, filled it from the water filter, stroked the cat and turned it on at the plug.

The anointed Royal Blue mug, emblazoned with the Queen's face was retrieved from the dishwasher and set ready on the side.  A single Yorkshire Tea bag was added, as was one-third of a teaspoon of sugar.  1/3 of a spoon is just enough sugar to add some "bass" to the tea, giving it more substance, taking the edge off.

The kettle roared.  The cat meowed and fussed for it's breakfast.

But.  Something felt wrong.

It was a Friday, the day the rubbish bins, bagged recycling, food and garden waste and empty glass bottles were collected by the burly members of the local council.  Twizzle glanced out of his kitchen window towards the back gate at the end of the garden.  No bags.  Good, he thought.  He had remembered to put them out last night.  Sometimes the bin men come very early, so it is best to be prepared the night before.

He glanced at his work provided, steam driven, hand-me-down laptop.

Was there something important going on with work today?  A meeting perhaps, where a virtual, lethargic gaggle of office-workers gathered to plan the next meeting and reflect on the scant notes from last one.  No.  It wasn't that either.

As the kettle reached it's steamy, bubbling crescendo and his mind turned to which biscuits he would have with his tea, the penny finally dropped.

"Poo!  I've lost my streak on Cowriters again... buggeration, damn and blast it all to merry hell!"
