I did the weekly food shopping earlier and it looks like everything is starting to return to "the new normal".  The signs are still up, with markings on the floor telling people to keep 2 meters apart, but no-one is taking any notice.  Even the one-way system the supermarket had introduced is gone.  I can finally safely back up the aisle when I miss something, without getting glared at or told off by the staff.

The game I now play is "spot the mask", counting how many people (including myself) are wearing one.  I was impressed by the mother and her young son who entered the store in front of me.  They both had masks on and took time to stop to sanitize their hands and the trolley before they started.

Most people just don't bother wearing a mask.  However, the rate of infection in my area is very low and the number of deaths per day in the local hospital has dropped to pretty much zero.  I suspect the risk is low, but there is still a chance I might catch something.

Whilst I was searching out some bacon, I did hear someone coughing and spluttering in another aisle.  It didn't sound good to me, so I scooted off quickly in the opposite direction.  I wonder if some security guards were quickly on the scene to herd him out of the store with cattle prods?  Doubt it, but I wonder if that might happen in the future.

I don't have an issue wearing a mask, even today when it is 21 degrees (warm-ish for the UK).  Sure, it gets a bit stuffy and it was shifting around as I was chewing gum, but for the hour I am in the store, it is no inconvenience to me.  At least people are not looking at you strangely when you are wearing a mask.  But I suspect they are secretly thinking "What an idiot!".

But I don't care one bit.

It's survival of the fittest, and most sensible!
