In the UK, this weekend is going to be the first warmth of the year.  The sun is out, the clothes are drying on the line and everyone seems to be in their garden.  Tomorrow, it will be even hotter.

This is already panicking the UK government.  At the first sign of a warm day, us Brits rush to the nearest park or beach and spend the day picnicking, huddling behind a wind-break, shielding our sandwiches from the actual sand.  Sunshine is a rare commodity sometimes, so we want to soak up as much as we can when it happens.

But, with the latest restrictions on going on imposed over the Coronavirus, this will not happen - or rather, SHOULD not happen.  There have been lots of medical specialists and government advice telling you to stay inside.  But, you can guarantee that some stupid families will meet somewhere they think is remote, trying to enjoy the sun.

Of course, being outside reduces the risk of catching the virus as it disperses in the open air more rapidly, but it does not remove the possibility completely.

One thing I have been looking forward to over this lockdown, is the stories about people who have been arrested for being where they shouldn’t be.  A sunny weekend is also the perfect time for the British folks to flock to a quaint, picturesque town or village in the hope of a [traditional cream tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_tea) (A pot of tea, a scone with strawberry jam and clotted cream).  A hot Sunday is not complete without this staple of Englishness culture.

Hopefully, I will get to read the stories on Monday where grannies have been thrown in prison for “popping out to the seafront to take in the air” or where gangs of local youths out “for a toke down the fields” with their friends are fined.

Why can’t people just follow rules?

Perhaps, until they are directly affected by the virus, they won’t take it seriously.  I still feel a little remote to the thousands of deaths being announced around the world.  On the news, they are just numbers, not people I know or friends of friends.

Until it comes to their homes, many people won’t respect the gravity of the situation we are in.
