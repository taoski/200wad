I watched a video earlier, where Ricky Gervais described British slang words.  I found it quite interesting and thought I would write a few down for my non-English Cowriter friends.  I will try to add to the list when I think of something new, or if you have any requests, let me know.

**Git**

No, nothing to do with programming, sorry to disappoint you.  The term "git" is used to describe someone who is either nasty, grumpy or a bad person.

Example: "You old git!" or "Oh no, you don't like him do you?  He's a total git!"

**Plonker**

A friendly term used to describe someone who is stupid or silly, often used for people who are not that bright who might have done something wrong.  It can also be used as a slang word for your penis.

Example: "He's a total plonker!" or "You plonker!" or "Are you pulling my plonker?" ("Pulling my plonker" meaning "are you joking with me?").

**Wazzock**

A word used to describe someone who is silly or stupid, or does silly and stupid things.

Example: "He's a complete and utter wazzock" or "You wazzock!  You did that wrong!"

**Cock-Womble**

This is an amalgamation of two terms.  "Cock" meaning penis or idiot and "Womble" which is a reference to a British children's TV show, The Wombles.  The show depicts some creatures (Wombles) who live on Wimbledon Common in London and wander around collecting litter.  I am not quite sure how or why they fit together - maybe they just work well as a slang term.

Example: "Boris Johnson?  He's a useless cock-womble"

**Bagsy**

This is usually reserved for when you are a child and you "Bagsy" something, meaning that because you called on it first, it belongs to you or it is something you get to do and no one else does.  A bit like calling shotgun on a car seat.

Example: "Bagsy I get to play on the Xbox when we get home!" or to make sure that you definitely get what you want, it can be extended thus - "Turn around, touch the ground, Bagsy I'm not it" (meaning I am not going to be "it" or the first person who has to chase and "tag" others in a playground game).

If no one has called "Bagsy" in a game of "Tag" or "Tig" as it is also known, kids assemble in a circle with one of their feet in the middle.  Someone then counts round the feet in turn, calling out a rhyme such as "Ip Dip, Sky Blue, Who's It, Not You" and the person it lands on removes their foot.  The process repeats until someone loses and becomes "it".

There are various more explicit rhymes that can be used during this process, such as "Ip Dip, Dog Shit, Fucking Bastard, Silly Twit, You Are Not It".  At age 8, those seemed very naughty!

**Deffo**

Short for definitely, meaning you are sure of something.

Example: "That was deffo a goal!" or "You are deffo going to get caned after school". ("Caned" meaning beat up, referring to that jolly time when British school teachers used a flexible wooden cane to whip children across the bum with as a punishment).

**Shit Loaf**

An alternative term used for toilet roll.  Also known as Bog Roll.

Example: "Oi, mate, chuck us up some shit loaf!  I've just sharted!" ("Sharted" meaning an unfortunate accidental combination of "Shitting" and "Farting").

**Chockablock**

A term used to mean busy or full, usually referring to the number of people in a place at one time.

Example: "The park was chockablock today!"

**Ledge**

This is short for "Legend" and is used to describe someone who is a great person or has done something amazing.

Example: "Rooney is a total ledge!  He muffed the shot and still scored with his nut!" (Muffed meaning "messed up" and "nut" meaning head).

**Offy**

Short for Off-Licence, which is a shop where you buy bottles or cans of alcohol from.  The same as a liquor store in the US.  In the UK, before the rise of the local 24-hour supermarket chains, the Offy was an easy place to buy booze if you were underage.

Example: "Are you goin' down the Offy?  Can you get me some fags?" ("Fags" meaning cigarettes).
