Last night was the final episode of the Grayson Perry's Art Club TV show.  He has been exploring art on specific topics each week, sharing art that has been sent in by viewers and also video chatting with celebrities who are artists too.  It has been a really enjoyable show and I am sad to see it finish.

My parents messaged me asking if I watched all of the shows.  They are both artistic and were following art careers before getting involved with teaching.  I was the same, heading to university for a fine art degree before I "accidentally" ended up working in IT instead.  They are always suggesting that I get back into drawing or painting.  They know I have some hidden talents that are going to waste.

Watching the show always makes me feel bad.

It makes me realize the path I have taken in life, shunning the artistic parts of myself for more logical, process driven things.  Sure, you can think creatively of how to fix a network issue, but there are limits.  It has been a long time since I was properly creative for my own satisfaction.  I can do it for other people, if they need images creating or photoshop work doing, but satiating my own itches is hard.

The show also makes me feel stupid.

Not stupid that I can't do it, but that I am not allowing myself to do it.  I have some sort of mental block when it comes to allowing myself to be "me".  I am very different to my "roots" of art, reading, writing and being creative.  I have lost it somewhere along the way, dropped into the murky mire of careers, mortgages, children, marriage and "life in general".

Seeing Grayson sitting quietly, designing patterns on a new piece of pottery made me wish for that kind of "space" to create.  I feel constricted and cannot start anything.  However, I also cuss myself for sitting and scrolling through Reddit when I could be doing something creative instead.

I kind of feel a bit like I would be betraying my family.

I feel like the very important cog in a priceless machine.  Without me keeping everything oiled and working at a moments notice, everything would fall apart.  I don't feel I am able to do what I would like to do.

But what is it I would like to do?  I have no idea :)
