Both of my Son's are musicians.  One is in a band with a record deal and the other is a solo artist, just getting ready to release his first track on Spotify.  There has never been a better time to be able to get your own music out there.

However, I can't see how artists make it "big" these days.  The amounts of money they make from the different streaming platforms hardly meets minimum wage.  Unless your tracks really take off, it is unlikely you would get a good income from streaming your songs.

It was probably the same before streaming took over.  Most artists would make good money from tours, merchandise, royalties and sponsorship rather than the number of records bought.  Getting a "Number 1 hit" is never a guarantee of riches and probably never was.

It is also interesting to see how many other companies surround the music industry.  From services like Distrokid who upload your songs to streaming and online store platforms for a yearly fee, to radio pluggers who, if they like your tracks, take it to radio stations to try to get your band on the playlist.  There are also armies of designers making promo teaser GIFs for Instagram stories, video crews to film you prancing around in a smoke-filler warehouse, stylists and recording studios.  The ecosystem surrounding the artists seems immense and I can only imagine it getting larger if they ever got famous.

Just now, my Son contacted someone via Facebook who runs several Spotify playlists that have over 20k followers.  They offer to add your track to one of their playlists for $50 a time which _should_ result in over 15k streams.  Not bad for only $50, but we are just unsure of how legit it is.  Will that $50 just disappear into someones PayPal account, never to be seen again, with only a lesson learned in return?

It all reminds me of the Make Money Online or Internet Marketing industry.  The people making the real money are those who are providing services for newbies.  Expensive training courses, eBooks, mentoring or subscription services are designed to sucker in people who need that helping hand.  After all, if I sell you a course on how to build a website to make money, most of the risk is on you.  Plus, my disclaimer will cover me if it doesn't work out well.

In reality, the record deal my Son has is pretty good.  They have given a lot of money as advance payments and have paid for music videos to be filmed and promotional materials to be made.  We believe their ultimate goal is to licence the band on to a larger label, meaning they will still get to keep a cut of the profits over several years.  It's hard to know who is being genuine.
