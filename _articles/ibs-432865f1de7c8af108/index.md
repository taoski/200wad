Many years ago, I went to the doctors complaining about stomach pains, acid indigestion, general fatigue and bloating.  They sent me for a few tests: ultrasounds of my stomach and kidneys, an endoscopy to check my throat and stomach and an MRI to see if I had an Alien face-hugger growing inside me.

All of the tests came back as negative.

In the end, the only option left to for the doctor was to diagnose me with IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.

I think it is just a catch-all diagnosis they give to modern men, working too hard, drinking too much coffee and not eating well enough to maintain a balanced internal ecosystem.  He sent me off with a printout of a FODMAP diet, which pretty much left me without anything to eat.

Fast forward a few years and generally, I am much better.  I still drink too much tea, which my stomach complains about, but usually, I feel ok.  I still get bloated and have discomfort, but I know to stay away from things that don’t agree with me.

Last night, we had a takeaway curry.  The first in about 2 years.  We have been saving money by not eating out too much or having takeaways whilst my wife was not working.  Now that things are a bit better moneywise, we can enjoy a few luxuries now and then.

But boy, has my stomach complained!

Not only that, my whole body is annoyed with me.

Compared to the “usual bodily reaction” you might have the night after eating a curry, I didn’t have to “go” for hours today - it seemed to have quite the opposite affect.  Instead, that greasy feeling and taste has been in my belly and innards all day, giving me stomach and back ache.  Perhaps someone sneaked in during the night and stole one of my kidneys without me noticing?  Sure feels like it!

I have also been feeling tired and sleepy all day.  My body is taking up all of my energy, its having to process all that fat.

Hopefully, tomorrow will be a better day.  I am sure I will be in agony if I have to sit at my laptop all day.
