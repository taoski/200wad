I am starting to lose the plot a bit with work.  Suddenly, so many things are happening at once, I am finding myself getting lost, forgetting things.

It doesn't help that my wife is finalising her dissertation, so is constantly asking me to help her with grammar, formatting her Word documents, creating charts and images for her and being a supportive shoulder to cry on.  I sometimes feel like I have a sping attached to my bottom.  No sooner do I return to my seat in the kitchen to do some work, she calls me back for more help.

Of course, when this happens, I forget I am supposed to be doing something I was looking at before.  Tickets get forgotten, meetings get missed or I only give half my attention to something and do it wrong.

Of course, I don't mind helping her, but it does get in the way of my day-to-day work sometimes.  A few weeks ago, after spending most of the day helping her edit her work, I had to finish my own work.  It was the beginning of the month, so I had lots of reporting to get completed.  I ended up working until after 11 PM in the end.

I am wondering the best way to approach stay organised.  I was interested in following the Bullet Journal method for a while (just the proper task management part, not the drawing unicorns on each page part...) but never followed through with it.  I got a new Moleskine book for Christmas two years ago and it is still sitting there, as crisp and as clean as the day it arrived.

I have also tried many different apps over the years and have never settled for long with any one thing.  Either they are too cumbersome to use, make things too complex or hit my limitations too quickly.  A manual hand-written journal seems the most logical, as it can be used for private stuff too (I have a personal life?).  But things can move fast in my job and I worry I will forget to write something down and the system starts to fall apart.

What I tend to do is have Notepad open and store notes in there in a random way.  I also don't save them either, so if my laptop crashes, it is all gone.  It's not perfect, but good for making quick notes when someone calls up out of the blue for some help.

What is everyone else using for managing their time and tasks?
