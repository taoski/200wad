It all begins with a little explanation, some apology and hopefully some welcoming hugs, cheers a few beers and party-poppers.

I did ask Bas to delete my account a few months ago.

The honest answer to "why?" was that I was not in a good place mentally that day.  I was struggling not to write something depressing and self-loathing but had noticed my writing heading in that direction again.

Being forced to go over old (mental) ground each day was tiring.  Despite me saying to Bas that I felt like my efforts to write would be better directed elsewhere, it never materialized.  I just stopped writing.

It was not healthy for me to continue, so I panicked and asked for everything to be removed.  No-one else knew I wrote here and I didn't want it discovered after the event.  I am not a perfect human, but peeking through my 200 words might leave you thinking I was only a few steps away from doing something silly.

Deleting everything seemed the most logical answer to me at the time.  I committed literary suicide.

But with hindsight, I do miss writing here and the little community I left behind.

Sure, I am still struggling with who I am, what I want to do, why I did all those things in my past and what I might accomplish (or not) in my future.  Not much has changed with me since "delete day".  I just feel the need to write again.

It won't all be flowers, kittens and snuggly blankets in front of the fire.

So here I am.

Am I back?  Time will tell.

_ps. I took a backup of my posts from before, so if there is anything people want me to revisit or re-post, let me know._
