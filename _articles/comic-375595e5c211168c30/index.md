My friend contacted me today to ask if I was interested in drawing a comic for him.  Nothing too adventurous, just a 3 or 4-panel comic, similar to what you might find out on the Internet.  The kind of stuff that gets shared on Reddit.

The first reaction that popped into my mind was a straight "No", but I also know that my friend wants to be a writer and that he feels quite stuck in quite a few ways.  So, I didn't say no outright.

It won't be anything serious and will probably just die out, but it might be worth a try.  Even if it just gives me something creative to do.
