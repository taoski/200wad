A few months ago we fully paid off our mortgage.  But it was not as much of an event as I thought.

We bought our house at the right time in the UK, before the prices skyrocketed, having some equity from our previous property and therefore had a fairly small monthly commitment anyway.  But the extra cash each month will come in handy as my wife is still completing her masters degree and not earning anything at the moment.

I am now wondering what to do with the extra money we have each month?  With the way the stock market has reacted to Coronavirus over the last few weeks, time to sink it into investing in anything other than gold (or face masks) is probably foolish.  I am not very savvy when it comes to money, so will probably wait for the markets to stabilize and take out some sort of UK investment (ISA) or a stocks and shares type thing (Vanguard).

However, I am getting near 50 now and need to be looking at my possible retirement which is potentially not as far away as I think.  I might be best to sink some more money into a private pension or top up an existing one.  Not sure I really want to be stacking shelves when I am 65 to make ends meet - but maybe it is too late.

The other option is to invest the additional money into building new websites or growing my existing ones.  This is with a view to selling them off in the future for up to 30 times their average monthly income, which shits all over most other investments.

However, like any investment, a website is also not a safe bet.  I think I am a risk-averse person, so am not sure which way to reinvest this extra monthly cash at the moment.
