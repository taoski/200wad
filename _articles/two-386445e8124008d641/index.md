I was in danger of running out of time to post something today.  The clocks going forward have added an additional layer of confusion to my increasingly blended days.

I read something on Twitter over the weekend.

"We are suffering from two Pandemics.  Coronavirus and Stupidity."

This is brining out the worst in some people, highlighting their selfishness, flaws and incompetence.  In others, we see brilliance, care and love.

I am finding it all quite tiring now.  Unknowingly being on edge for weeks is starting to show.  I am yawning by 8 PM, restless and unable to sleep.  Should I be doing something more?
