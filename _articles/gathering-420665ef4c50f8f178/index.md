After a few days of sun in the UK, people seem to have forgotten about the pandemic.  The high temperatures have addled their brains, turning them back into the sorts of idiots that helped spread it in the beginning.  The UK assembly of hypocrites, crooks, charlatans and do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do'ers (also known as the Tory Government) reduced the "COVID Alert Level" from 4 (a high or rising level of transmission - enforced social distancing) to 3 (the virus is in general circulation - social distancing relaxed).  But despite the bit about the virus still being in general circulation, people have taken it as a free pass to do what they want.

My wife an I took a walk on Monday at around 5 PM, only to find a group of 30 young people congregating together on a field.  They were pumping crappy grime music out of their bluetooth speaker and all sitting close together or play fighting with each other.  I didn't want to look too closely for fear of being battered, but I am sure there were several teens snogging each other in the midst of the throng too.

On Tuesday, the situation repeated itself as the temperatures climbed.  A large group of 20 or so lads were swimming in the river, having a barbecue and all sitting close to each other.  Further on during our walk, there were many groups of people sitting on the fields, drinking, having fun and certainly not social distancing.

You would think that the Coronavirus is finished, based on their behavior.

Of course, I am an old git compared to them.  I actually enjoyed muttering "they don't look like they are from the same family" to my wife when we spotted people close together when we were out exercising during the real lock down.

Of course, the risk is probably quite low.  The number of infections and deaths in my region are very low and it is still unlikely that you would catch anything from being too close to people.

But, the risk is still there and as other countries are now finding, lifting, relaxing or ignoring restrictions has started to cause a spike in cases again.  The lock down is returning for them and it will most likely be the same for the UK too.

There is a well-known saying: "Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun".

What about "Mad Englishmen" too?  Idiots.
