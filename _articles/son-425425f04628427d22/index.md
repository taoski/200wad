My youngest son is now 18 and out of full-time education.

He now seems to spend his time in bed, watching Minecraft videos, or being sarcastic on Twitter.  Often, he will float downstairs to get food and disappear again, or materialize, inform us he is bored and then retreat back to his room again.

At 18, I also had no idea what I wanted to do.

I had finished my A-Levels and had no plans.  I didn't want to go to University and ended up spending the summer doing shitty jobs, like washing up for £2.50 per hour.  I think my spliff-addled brain didn't know where it was going.  I was more worried about getting to Glastonbury Festival than my career.

In the end, I opted to go back to college to complete a 2-year art foundation course.  Again, I didn't have plans to go to University after that, it was just a stop-gap as I didn't really want a job.

I announced to my parents I was going to college after visiting a temporary employment agency, getting assigned an immediate start in a role in an office a short walk away.  I wandered down the hill towards the location, got on a bus and went home.  I didn't realize it was depression that made me do this at the time, but it was also clear that I didn't really want to work in an office.

By the time I got home, the employment agency was calling, trying to find out where I was.  I pretended to be my Father and they berated me, telling me my Son wouldn't achieve anything if that was the way he was going to behave.  I'm sure they knew it was really me.

Of course, things are different now compared to that day 30 years ago (fuck, i'm old!).

My own son has as much opportunity to make a career online from his bedroom as he does washing up, working in a supermarket or office.

My parents never pressured me to do anything or choose a direction.  They were both teachers, so could tell I was able to make my own way and make my own choices.  They knew I would work it out myself in the end, make it through the "drugs days" and emerge doing something I would enjoy and excel at.  And, they were right.

But my son has many more options to choose from now.  The entire world is open to him, compared to when I was young.  That narrow-minded view I had at 18 or 19, has expanded for him.  Anything is possible with the Internet at his fingertips.

I just hope he works things out for himself too, but having a job in an office or shop is a good way to get to know yourself and become a more sociable person.  He could do with getting out there a bit more, making friends and speaking to people.  He is a little introverted, to say the least.

Of course, it doesn't help that he has inherited quite a bit of money from his Grandparents, who passed a few years ago.  In all honesty, he could get away with not working for the next 5 years and afford to live on his own, if he wanted.

I am sure he is thinking "Why do I want a job, when I have all this money and have nothing to spend it on anyway?"

I wonder how I can help him in the right direction?
