I had a father and son company come over today to replace an old broken fence for me.  It has been broken for over 5 years and has been getting worse, so it was time to call in the professionals to do the job.

I irks me that I am not able to do it myself.  I once worked with a chap who was (and still is) regularly digging post holes, laying slabs or decking in his garden, whilst I struggle to put anything up.  It's not that I am really that bad at DIY, I tend not to have the right tools or equipment.  Or if I do, I can never put my finger on them when I need them.

The ease in which they dismantled the existing fence, using a tool to split the panels and remove them, then digging holes using another bespoke tool, make it all look very easy.  Of course, they had circular saws, compressed air nail guns and all manner of other hardware at their disposal.

It always makes me feel quite inadequate.

However, they might have glanced into the kitchen and saw me fixing a server remotely, which they would not have a clue about either.  I possess more "soft skills" than they do.  My hands are designed for coding and answering the telephone, rather than fitting close-board fencing.

I am glad the job is done though and I feel it is worth paying the price to have someone good come to do the job.  Could I have done it myself?  Probably, but it would have taken 10 days instead of half and cost me a lot of money in materials and probably a few fingers too.  Sometimes, it is money well worth spending.
