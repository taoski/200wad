I have a tension, pressure headache today.

I didn't feel right after I awoke, tense and stiff inside, unable to get comfortable in my body.

I drove my wife to work and felt like I couldn't quite catch my breath, even though it was just tension in my chest that was stopping me, not a lung full of covid. After I dropped her, I drove back with the window open, letting the cool air refresh me. I thought it might be stress or anxiety, so I squeezed in a few quick hard slaps and pinches of my thigh whilst sitting at traffic lights. It didn't seem to help much.

A coffee and cookie seemed to help after I got home and settled in front of the laptop to work.

So many things were swirling around my head that I needed to do. Emails were arriving, the phone was ringing, I was forgetting everything I needed to do and I was still missing some files from yesterday. It was all closing in on me, coming out as a headache from squinting at the screen and the pressure of everything I hadn't done.

By 3 PM the headache is in full force. I just want to close my eyes and drift away in a darkened room to Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, or something soothing that reminds me of when I was young, carefree and not worried about stuff so much.

But, I must power on through. I will drink lots of water rather than rely on any medicinal help. Lots of water will also help relieve the pain.

I wonder when it will all end.
