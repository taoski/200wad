A while ago, I upgraded our iCloud storage to the 2TB tier.  As our devices were getting larger storage, the backups we needed to do were just maxing out the free allowances you get.  But I had never really considered how iCloud Drive works.

In my mind, your hard disk has a limited amount of fixed storage.  If you are running out of space, it would be ideal to be able to drag old or seldom accessed files to the iCloud Drive to keep, in case you needed them at another time.  But it does not work that way.  If a file is in the iCloud Drive, it still exists on your hard disk and OSX or iOS only removes the local copy when it decides it is old and can be stored safely elsewhere.

Both of my Sons work with a lot of video editing, music production and Photoshop type files.  Video editing especially, with Apple Final Cut Pro, takes up a lot of local storage.  It would make so much sense just to be able to drag an old project file to the iCloud Drive, where it is kept safe and get rid of the space from your hard drive, allowing you to work on more projects.  But like I say, it does not work that way, it seems.

I had read that one way around this is to still pay to have an iCloud account with lots of storage, but never set up your devices to sync with it, just uploading files to it via a web browser.  But this is not an ideal solution to fix the problem.  We have an 80Mb upload speed on our fiber Internet connection from home, it should be easier than this!

Perhaps it is time to buy some beefy, fast backup drives or some network-attached storage for us all to use.  Bun then why am I paying for the 2TB iCloud when I can't use it properly how I want.  It's pretty crazy.

I would be interested to hear how others are handling storing and offloading so much data all the time.
