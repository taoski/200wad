So, it looks like we are self-quarantining for 2 weeks.

Our family have all had little coughs and colds over the last 3-4 weeks.  I have been pretty run down too, so was not surprised when I caught a head cold too.  But my eldest Son picked up a new cough last week.

Again, we didn't think much of it, there was no fever and the cough is not what I would call "persistent" or "continuous".  It seems to follow more of a pattern of being worse at night and in the morning - which is how I would describe a normal cold.

But he got a message last night from a friend to say that she was self-isolating with a fever and cough and that she was having trouble breathing too.  He had been to see her last week, just before his cough came on.

He also works in a local coffee shop and shortly after getting the first message, got a message from his colleague who he has been working with regularly last week and yesterday.  Her mother, who she lives with, is self-isolating with a fever and cough.

So, we all took the decision to start a 2 week isolation.

It has been difficult sorting things out and we may have to do a quick-dash to the postbox shortly, but I hope we will be ok.  It is not as if we can't go out (as in ruled by law) but we just need to be super careful.  I don't mind doing my food shopping at 3 AM if I have to!

Time to do an Amazon Pantry order I think!

Stay safe everyone, the enemy is at the border!
