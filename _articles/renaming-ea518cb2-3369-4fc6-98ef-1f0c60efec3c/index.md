It has been a bit of a less stressful day today.

Sharepoint has decided to be a little more helpful today, allowing me to "Open with Explorer" and drag and drop some files across in bulk.

But this just throws up more challenges. Sharepoint has a limitation on file name length, the use of characters like # or & in the names and other foibles it forces on you.

So when I dragged and dropped a bunch of folders over, the process stops, telling me the file type is invalid and not allowed to be uploaded. This really means something different and that I need to stop and rename things and try again.

I found a program called [Advanced Renamer](https://advancedrenamer.com/), which allowed me to scan a folder and remove anything dodgy from the file names first. Hopefully, this will make the process a little smoother when I get time to start uploading again. I am sure I will be hit with the same path/file name length problem still, but I am better prepared.

I don't believe Sharepoint was destined to be used in anger. When we were asked to use it for work purposes years ago, it was slow, cumbersome and didn't allow us to store things like Microsoft Access files (.mdb). Sure, you can share or version files like that very well, but it would have been useful to just keep them somewhere. In the end, we moved back to using networked file storage, which was quicker and easier to use. Yes, you get issues where you need to open a file someone else has already opened and left for the day, but it's not the end of the world.

I guess we just need to adapt and move on. And in truth, there are only a small number of files I need real-time access to that I regularly reference or update. The rest are copies of contracts or old shit we probably should have dropped on a USB stick and archived in several places.

The one thing, as a Google Chrome user, is that Sharepoint only really works well with Internet Explorer. You can browse the folders and open files in Chrome, but to properly edit them, you still have to use IE. Even the new Microsoft EDGE browser doesn't offer the same functionality as IE does.

Come on Microsoft... get your shit together!
