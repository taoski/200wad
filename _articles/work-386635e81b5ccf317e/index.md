Over the weekend, my friends and I were talking about mentors and inspirational figures in our lives - but I couldn't really think of anyone specific.  I was then asked "When you were young, what did you want to be when you grew up?"

But the answer was that at the time, I had no idea.

I have always been a "go with the flow" person, taking opportunities as they arise, progressing through being seen to be good at something, not necessarily from a goal I have worked towards.  My career achievements have mostly come through serendipity - not that I am shit at my job - I have just fallen into the right role, with the right people at the right time.

I was due to go to Art School but opted for a summer office job I never left and I wound up in an IT support role.  Nothing was planned, I just evolved into the job, along with the introduction of Microsoft Windows, networks, the Internet and email.

My friend talked about him wanting to be a writer after hearing the clack of a typewriter from someones house as he walked past, seeing them sitting at a desk looking out at the world go by with a coffee, cigarette and (what was) a bohemian looking decor.

I have also had a similar thought over the years.  Me, alone in a cottage in the English countryside, working on my writing whilst looking out at the rain, sipping on my tea and stroking my cat.

Again, an idealistic view of what being a writer is or could be.

I think my view goes back to when I was younger, sitting on my bed with a hot cup of tea, a fantasy novel or comic in my hand and rain dashing against the window.  I was safe back then, escaping off to far-away lands with no expectations other than to enjoy the moment.

My friend also ended up working in IT too.

Did your childhood dreams (of work) end up a reality?
