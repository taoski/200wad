I cleaned up the laptop I am giving to my friend today.  Gave it a blast of compressed air and a rub down with an oily rag for good measure.  I hope it works out for his son.  I said to him that if it wasn’t quite right, he could sell it on to buy something better, putting in a portion of his money too.

Of course, he asked me what he could give me in return and after jokingly asking for rude pictures and the soul of his first-born, I settled on saying:

“Nothing.  Just glad I could help out.”

I felt good about being able to say that, but also felt a little bit of a wanker for saying something a bit corny.  But he knew what I meant.

I worry for him and his family.  They moved back from Canada a few years ago and have settled, bought a house and gotten jobs, but are still finding it hard to make ends meet.  He jokes about never being able to afford to retire, which I know is probably not 100% true, but a scary thought all the same.

The annoying part of his conundrum is that he is a writer and a damn good one at that.  He has written several short-stories, a screenplay and always has something on the boil, but only in his mind.  A young family, pressured job and all that ”life bollocks” gets in the way of following his destiny.

So what I would really want to give him, is a kick up the arse, a slap around the chops with a wet fish, a stern talking to whilst also pulling him up by his bootstraps.  He has so much potential and I worry he will waste it, living an unfulfilling life, grinding away to earn money when he could be creating.  It’s a parallel I see in my own life too, which is why it burns so badly.

I toyed with the idea of buying him a years subscription to Medium, where he can write and also reach some sort of audience.  I am sure he would do well given half a chance.  I don’t even know if that is something you can buy - I will have to check.

Maybe I will slip a letter into the box with the laptop, hoping to spur him into action.

If I am not the one to be the creative writer, then I hope to be an “enabler” or a “fixer” to instil that in someone else who deserves it probably a little more than me.
