My son splurged £2600 on a new MacBook Pro today, possibly the thing of highest value he has ever bought.  Despite being 21, he was still wary and a little scared to click the "Buy Now" button.

His old MacBook Pro, which we got him when he took a music course at school is still going strong, despite being 5 years old.  However, now he is in a band and is recording, mixing and producing their music, it is starting to cause problems.  My MacBook Pro which is from 2012 is still going strong, although I have upgraded the RAM to 16Gb and added 2 SSD drives over the years.

My career has been based around fixing Windows PCs, even from the DOS days.  One thing that I really notice about a Windows PC is that, over time, it slows down a lot.  Even if you copy off all of the data, reformat the hard disk and reinstall Windows from scratch, it never seems quite as quick as it once did.  The conspiracy nuts among us might be thinking that Microsoft have done this deliberately, but with every revision of Windows, it tends to use more features and need more power.  Plus, older style SATA or IDE hard disks just get slower in the end.

However, this never really seems to happen with Apple products.  Not that I have had to re-image many times over the years, mind you.  My 8 year old MacBook just powers on through regardless and I can't see myself needing to upgrade or replace it any time soon.  Sure, it weighs a ton and compared to it's 13 inch cousins, is a showing it's age here and there, but it has stood the test of time.

I can't see myself going back to a Windows laptop any time soon, despite the lower entry price.
