I have a curse.

My brain is constantly fast-forwarding to "future mode" where if I start to learn or experience something new, I am immediately thinking of ways to streamline or improve.

Take the example of learning Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  Instead of getting my fingers dirty and taking action, my brain starts to think of apps or spreadsheets I could create to help myself or others work better.

Perhaps it is not "future mode" but more of a "need to help" mode?

There is a massive amount of community spirit at the moment around the Coronavirus, with people offering local help street by street, companies open-sourcing their designs for ventilators, different health organizations working together across continents, companies stopping or lowering charges, landlords being relaxed about rent payments and teachers offering home help to parents and children.

My "need to help" brain is busy thinking of ways to assist, but my future brain can't quite see the outcome of this situation.

Will this altruism become the new "normal"?

Will this rally to help people continue once this threat has passed, or will we all return to the way we were. 

Once the government and legal investigations/reviews are carried out, will they be looking to place blame on people, prosecute companies for not acting correctly or removing politicians for taking the wrong action?  I was just reading of people dumping stocks and shares after private government briefings a few weeks ago, which is akin to insider trading.

Will all of this good feeling towards others and hope for each other disappear into profit and hate again?
