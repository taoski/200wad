I woke up feeling groggy again today after about 4-5 days of feeling better.  My sinuses feel blocked again and my head feels like it is being squashed.  I also feel a little prickly, like I have a temperature, but don't according to my digital thermometer.  My throat feels a little raw, like I have had bad acid reflux and my ears and neck feel uncomfortable, like they are full of mucus.

My wife has also developed a small cough and a bit of a sore throat too.  We suspect it is hay fever related, which she suffers from, not me, but it is not in the realms of impossibility for it to affect me more one year than the previous?

We are supposed to be trying for a short run later today to start her back on the path to fitness again.  She has been working and studying so hard she has had to give up running for now.  It is a small sacrifice to make, but when you are spending extra time sitting, it all starts to take its toll on your body after a while.

We have been out walking every day for the last few weeks though and have walked on average, about 7k per day too.  Perhaps I just need to increase the water intake and get some extra sleep.  I have been waking up a lot during the nights recently and have been going to bed later than normal too (Yes, Brandon.. I am a naughty boy...).
