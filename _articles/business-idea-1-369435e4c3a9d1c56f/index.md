I had an idea to start a business the other day and thought I would write it down.

Firstly, to make the idea more concrete in my mind and secondly to give someone else the opportunity to start it for themselves.

**The background:**

As a hobby, I create websites that participate in the Amazon Associates program where I get paid for referrals to Amazon when people buy products.

So, as an example, my website page about "The Best Dog Food For Tiny Dogs" might recommend certain products and if you read my review, click through and buy it, Amazon pay me a small commission.

However, one thing that some affiliate sites lack is what I would call "authentic content".

Google has recently been promoting what it calls "[E-A-T](https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t)": Expertise, Authority and Trust.  Can visitors trust what your website is telling them?  Are you an authentic source of information?  Can your visitors trust you not to harm them, especially when it comes to topics such as health or money?

Sure, I can pick a random product on Amazon, write about the benefits, pros and cons, highlighting what people have said in their reviews and other alternatives you might consider, but I am simply regurgitating the information that is already out there and not adding any real "value".  I am simply collating and summarizing existing content.

**The idea:**

So, to counter this possible lack of trust, my business idea is to **pair up affiliate marketers and existing product owners**.

In return for being paid a small fee (around $10 or on a sliding scale) the product owners provide some real feedback on a product, their own images, videos, experiences and critique.  In return, the affiliate website owner gets unique content that can demonstrate some credibility and trust.

**The implementation:**

From a technical perspective, the business idea would need a website where both affiliate website owners and product owners can register and offer or request product reviews.

However, I am not sure if it would be best for people to request a product or for product owners to offer.

As a product owner myself, I can see 20 things in my immediate reach where I could offer them up for review - so perhaps it might lead to too much information being published.  It might make more sense for website owners to reach out to product owners who can respond directly:

*   WANTED: Nike AlphaFly
*   WANTED: Nespresso Essenza Mini

An alternative method would be for someone to start a "product review as a service" (PRAAS) where affiliate website owners contact them to obtain images, video or critique for a specific product review and they go out and find someone who owns the product to get the information.  How they reach those buyers is another issue though.

**How it makes money:**

Each product owner would be paid direct through the service as they sell their information/photos/videos and I would take a cut or small fee per transaction.

Alternatively, a monthly subscription model could be used for both buyers and sellers where the business mainly offers a way for the 2 parties to meet.

**How I would start (MVP):**

For a minimum viable product, I would identify a niche market (such as dog owners) and join communities on Reddit or Facebook and approach the group owners to ask if I can post a request for owners to join my service.

I would collect information from the dog owners, including their contact information.

I would then reach out on SEO or Internet Marketing groups on Facebook asking for people with sites in the dog/pet niche to join.

I might initially set up a small spreadsheet or Facebook group where people can connect, or act as the middle-man between the 2 groups, just to prove there is demand for this type of service.

Once the system had been proven, I would set up the website to handle the service (easier said than done!) and expand the number of niches that it covers.  I would then advertise on Facebook or approach niche groups to spread the word about the service.
