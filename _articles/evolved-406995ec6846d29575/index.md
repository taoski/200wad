I had a spare 6 hours yesterday when I had no "real work" to do, so decided to sit down and research some new keywords to write an article about on one of my websites.

For some reason, I have a real block at the moment with taking action to write.  I can come here once a day and vomit out some drivel, but sitting down to plan a proper article just feels too hard.  I am not 100% sure, but I feel I am suffering from impostor syndrome.  I worry that the article I try to write won't be good enough anyway.  I also have a feeling that even if I do work hard on the piece, it won't be effective and that I will feel dejected if it doesn't.

One of the main issues is that I am trying to write on a health related topic.  I have some experience of the medical condition, but no training and I have been trying to cultivate the site into a more holistic resource.  Google does not like to show searchers medical articles that are not properly credited, cited or researched.

Maybe I don't find writing about things I don't know rewarding any more.  There was a time when I was bashing out thousands of words a week on topics I had no ideas on.  Discovering, understanding and researching those topics was part of the fun.  Making money from it was best though.

Perhaps I have risen above such trivial things now.  I have put away those immature topics and want to be a better and more authentic writer.  Have I evolved beyond that now?
