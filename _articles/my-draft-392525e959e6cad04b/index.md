As you may have [read](https://cowriters.app/words/rss-block-392135e9494d37a942) in my posts here [recently](https://cowriters.app/words/gutenberg-389385e8a53da6771b), I have been working on creating a new Gutenberg block for Wordpress to allow people to easily show eBay items in their posts and make money (if they are an eBay affiliate).

My son has been using my laptop for some of his projects over the last week, so I haven't gotten much done, but managed to grab some hours on it over the last few days.  It is still not working, but I am getting to understand how blocks are created now and what I need to do.

The thing that annoyed me was that I was not getting any support on this from my wife.  No, I am not expecting her to learn PHP or react.js to help, but each time she asked me what I was doing, she either said either it was "boring" or "do you have to do it right now?".  She was bored of sitting in the garden on her own.

She has no interest in what I do, but expects me to read her university essays, understand the subject, comprehend what she is trying to learn or say and help edit it.  I like to help her and I know she is appreciative, but if the situation was reversed and I was getting upset because I didn't understand why my code was working, I would be expecting her to quickly learn PHP, WordPress, FTP and a host of other things to even try to assist.

The fact that she just says things like "Boring" shows she has no inclination of even trying to understand.  Perhaps if she said "What are you working on?  Can you explain it to me?" instead, it would have been better.  Shutting me down like that just makes me want to close the laptop and give up.

Sure, the two things are probably worlds apart when it comes down to it.  I think I instinctively know where a comma or semi-colon should go in a sentence, but trying to learn coding syntax to help might be a stretch for some people.
