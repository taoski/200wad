I wrote a few days ago about feeling groggy and ill, that I had a temperature and I was wondering if it was the start of COVID getting me.

Well, it didn't turn into anything at all.  The feeling that I had a temperature, a hot back and torso, didn't get any worse.

I have been running more recently and my back, between my shoulder blades is hurting.  The muscles there must be tight and inflamed, causing me to think I had a temperature.  At some points, it felt like I had sunburn, but with pain radiating around to my chest too.

Back pain is not something I have suffered from much in relation to running, but my left hand does go a little numb sometimes when I am running.  If I roll my shoulders forward after I have stopped, I can feel the nerve being trapped and released, down my arm and into my hand.

I still think I do have something underlying that is causing me trouble at the moment.  I still feel like I have some sort of sinus problem or infection.  My head still feels bunged up and I am sneezing occasionally too.

On a silly side note, I have worked out a way I can "wank my nose" to make myself sneeze if I feel I need to.  I tap in rhythm on each side of the bridge of my nose and it stimulates the nerves there, making me cum.. err.. sneeze.  It's a great relief and something I can get away with around the dinner table.

I am wondering if I have a dust allergy.  My house is quite old and dusty (built in 1914) and the more I have been inside, the worse it seems to have gotten.  Perhaps dust really is getting up my nose.
