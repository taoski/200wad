The UK economy is officially in a recession now.  It is even worse than the global crash of 2008 when I lost my job.  I was "contractor scum" then and was an easy cost saving.

My 18 year old Son has just left college but it not going to University.  He is drifting from YouTube video to Twitter, to Netflix and back again, spending most of his day laying on his bed.  He is a few weeks away from depression, if he is not there already.

The chance of him picking up a J.O.B. is quite slim, seeing as many places are closing and laying people off.  There have been stories of a pub trying to recruit a barman and over a thousand people applied.  What chance does an 18 year old have at the moment?

Actually, I think this could be a good time for him.

He is a photographer and knows his way around Photoshop, Final Cut Pro X, Ableton, Logic X as well as many other things.  He is in a good position to become a remote worker.  He doesn't like people too, so that's a bonus.  With a push, I bet he could get good at things like Figma or WordPress too.  All valuable skills to have.

The problem is that, for him, it is "all too much effort".

Despite that being a typical teenager response, I get it.

I have felt that way too, lots of times.  Its hard to move away from what you know or have settled in to.  Taking that first step is the hardest part and maintaining it is even harder.

How do you engage and inspire a teenager like that?
