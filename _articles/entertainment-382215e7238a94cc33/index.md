I wonder if the virus will change the way we consume entertainment in the future.

I know Universal are looking to release their new movies as on-demand 48 hour rentals in the US, seeing as cinemas are closed.  Could this be a new way for films to be released?

I would quite happily pay £25 to rent a new film for 48 hours, rather than spend £70 for the whole family to go to the cinema.  If the film was good, I would probably watch it twice too!

Two main staples of UK TV, Eastenders and Coronation Street, soaps that are shown 3 times a week normally, have all ceased filming too.  Eastenders announced that they are moving to only show 2 episodes per week now in an attempt to reduce the impact.  However, both soaps will soon get to the point where they have no more episodes pre-filmed to release.  They usually only film 8 weeks in advance.  Plus, the main focal point of the community in Eastenders is a pub, which should be closing!

I also read that the pirating of online media has increased during these lockdowns, as has usage of online gaming.  Perhaps this will be the catalyst for us all to move towards a new online only life, unable to leave the house much in case of infection.

Perhaps we are only a few years away from The OASIS as depicted in Ready Player One (the book, not the crappy film).
