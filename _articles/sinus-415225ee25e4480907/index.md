I went running last night and managed 5k, without too much worry.  It's nice to get back to a good running program.

But I was feeling like crap most of the day.  I hadn't slept well because I was snoring and my wife was worrying about writing her dissertation.  The fact that I was keeping her awake just made her anxiety worse.  I ended up getting up at 6 AM to try to give her a few more hours of peace.

When I set off for my run at 6 PM, I decided I was going to take it easy.  I can quite happily jog along at a pace of 5 minutes 40 seconds per kilometer without getting too tired.  That used to be my half-marathon pace.  But I was a bit worried I might keel over at any moment.  I felt sufficiently rough that I decided not to take certain routes that would mean that if I dropped down with a sudden heart attack, someone might not find me for a few hours.

I was eyeing up a path between some offices, but as I thought about going that way, I got a sharp stab in my breastbone, almost like my body was telling myself to not go that way.  "Only bad things await you if you go down that path."

However, I am blaming my current "rough feelings" on problems with my sinuses; post-nasal drip (undiagnosed of course, apart from by Dr Google).

I seem to constantly have a bad taste in my mouth and stomach acid rising all the time, burning the back of my throat.  I am taking antacids before bed most nights.  

I had to pop to the offiice earlier to collect a server for some testing and by the time I had done that, popped to get some supplies for dinner tonight and driven back home, I had a real burning pain under my ribcage.  The cup of tea I had when I got home burned in that spot as I swallowed.

If course, the acid and pain does not stop me drinking 6-10 cups of tea or coffee a day, plus a beer when I am making dinner.  I shake my head to myself when I click on the kettle in the morning.  I am like an addict.

I wonder how long I can put up with feeling like this before I will end up at the doctors?  I also have that nagging feeling that I am pretending to blame how I feel on my sinuses.  Perhaps it is an ulcer or something more sinister.  Stories of cancer are all over the news at the moment, which does not make me feel any better.

I am under pressure at home and at work, so maybe I just need a break from this constant stress.  But I don't see that coming any time soon with all of the work projects piling on and the wife's degree coming to a stressful end.  There does not seem any way out for me at the moment.

If I write here one day that I have something terminal after an organ decided to burst as I pulled up my underpants, don't be surprised.  At least I will get to have a proper rest as they stuff me with tubes and radioactive chemicals.

Heck, someone might even make _me_ a cup of tea for a change.
