On the outside you would think I am fine.  I crack jokes, manage to hold down my 9-to-5 and wrangle my home and family commitments like a pro.  But underneath beats the heart of a frazzled hypochondriac who is listless and lost in his life.

From the moment I wake up to the time I pass into sleep, I worry.  As I stumble from bed and go for my wake-up wee, I worry I will see blood in the toilet after.  I grit my teeth as I glimpse down.  I walk downstairs to my my cup of tea (a classic British ritual that you get deported for if you fail to complete within 10 minutes of waking up) and stand, worrying that my lower back pain is something other than too much running in old trainers followed by sitting hunched over a computer for too long.

By the time my cuppa is finished, it has hit my stomach which retaliates like it has been tackled by a rubgy team.  Perhaps I am allergic to milk, to the wheat in those biscuits I had?  Perhaps it is something more sinister.

My head starts to hurt, sinuses flaring up and I yawn.  Why am I so tired when I have only just woken up?  I do sleep, but sometimes keep waking up for no reason.  Perhaps I have sleep aponea?  How many hours did I actually get?  I am not sure.

After a few hours my eyes are twitching from screen-ache.  I worry my eyes are getting fucked up as I squint at the screen with one eye closed.  My wife talks to me from the other room and I struggle to catch what she is saying.  My ears are failing me too!  What next?  I let the relentless, aging passage of time wash over me and try to accept it.

Another trip to the toilet leads to more anxiety that when I stand up there will be a bowl full of red or black.  Luckily, there never is, but I still feel like I have had a deep enema scraping out my intestines after.  It makes me feel tired, bloated and slow.

I sit in the chair and wonder again why my back hurts.  I feel like shitting out the rugby-ball the players left in me, but nothing is there, save the odd fart if I am lucky.

Lunch-time comes and I am stuck in a cycle of not being able to choose what to eat.  For one, I am a fussy eater, so I will just be repeating what I usually have, which I hate.  But two, I need to be wary of choking on the food, so choosing an appropriate texture is also important.  Choking on food is a worry I have (especially when driving) as food does get stuck in my throat quite often.  Is it stress?  An intolerance to something I had earlier?  Throat cancer?  Who knows.  Sometimes it is easier not to eat anything substantial, but to graze throughout the day.

If I go out in the car I am anxious behind the wheel, gripping it for dear life.  The pressure drains the saliva from my body and I have to do some weird jerking motion with my shoulder to help me swallow.  Chewing gum also helps but if I feel my throat close, the electric shock of adrenaline overwhelms me and I have to slow down.  By the time I am home I feel like a nervous wreck.

But later, I can run up to 10k without any problems.  My chest feels slightly raw, but it's cold and damp in the UK at the moment and it passes after the first 5-6k.  I feel good after like I could carry on.  I guzzle water when I finish, knowing my body needs it.  How can I run successfully like this when I feel so shitty most of the time?  Surely that has to be a good sign?  I am confused.

I cook dinner but serve myself up a smaller plate than anyone else because I need to eat slower; the choking fear is back.  Or if I have not quite cooked enough food, I give myself less - I can always graze a little more later.

After dinner I sit in the chair berating myself for all of the things I never did today.  I glance at my iPad and MacBook and feel like I should be drawing, writing, coding or creating something, but a shitty program on the television I don't want to watch takes up my attention span.

I make a mental list of the things I didn't do today including cleaning the kitchen and bathrooms properly.  A long list of chores I never seem to get round to spiral off into my brain.  I yawn my head off until my eyes water.  I am tired from not really doing anything all day.

It is another day I am unhappy, mainly with myself.

Bed-time comes and I snuggle, trying to find a position where the nagging muscular/skeletal chest pain I get (costochondritis) feels supported.  The wife sirs and steals the duvet again and I am left with a triangle that just covers my stomach.  It will have to do.

And when I wake up tomorrow: rinse and repeat.

I know I am not happy but I don't know where to start to fix things.
