I'm running out of time to write something today.  So I will settle for a quick blurb.

I feel rough this evening.  Probably something I have eaten.  Either that, or I am having an anxiety attack.  Possibly a combination of both.

I should probably try to sleep after taking an antiacid tablet or three.

I thought it would be my wife who fell after finishing her dissertation.  But it looks like it might be me this time.
