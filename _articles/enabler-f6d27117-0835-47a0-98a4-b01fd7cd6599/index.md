I have noticed a feeling recently that I have no idea where I am going, or what outcome or event I am moving towards.

My wife has almost finished her masters degree now and is working towards starting her own business. All the work she did was taking her in a certain direction, towards an outcome.

I don't have this.

I am busy with "work stuff", new projects have come out of the woodwork now that the Coronavirus madness has died down a little. But in my personal life, I am just aimlessly scooting along like a discarded shopping trolley in an empty car park. I have no real direction, just taking each bump or obstacle as they come, dealing with my dodgy wheel taking me off course now and again.

But I am also confused. Should I really have goals? Should I be working towards something I can achieve in the future, or is just living in the here and now an okay thing to do?

Is it enough for me to just be an "enabler" for others, letting them make the achievements as I do everything else around them to allow it to happen? My wife has been studying various things for 15 years, so it must be some time before then when she last made me a cup of tea. It's probably not true, but I enabled her to do that study, to get to where she wanted and needed to go to be happy.

But did I enable myself out of my own life at the same time?
