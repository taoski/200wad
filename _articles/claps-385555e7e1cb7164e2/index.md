The UK was cajoled into doing the 8 PM "Clap for our NHS" thing last night.

We opened our bedroom window, which overlooks the street and clapped along with our neighbors to celebrate the nurses, doctors and other medical staff who are working so hard against this virus.

I felt quite stupid actually and only half-clapped, in a way that made me look like I was joining in, but I was hardly making any noise.  What a time to be self-conscious!

It didn't take long for the British sarcasm to kick in on Twitter and Reddit.

_"My wife works in a hospital treating COVID-19 victims.  How many more claps does she need to collect before she gets more protective equipment?"_

This is just the British way of dealing with things.

"We laugh in the face of fear and tweak the nose of terror" (a Blackadder quote - go watch it if you have never seen it - British comedy at it's finest, although the first series is best skipped through IMHO).

Yesterday evening, we were also treated to our weekly live, televised politics question and answer show called BBC Question Time.  Usually filmed in front of a "balanced audience" made up of "looney-lefties", "posh-boy tories", "scum of the earth racists" and planted idiots who spout abuse as soon as the mic wavers near their toothless mouths.

Usually, none of their vitriol is backed by any common-sense or knowledge of the issues.  "Yeah... just get Brexit done!  It's the will of the people!" but when questioned what benefits Brexit will give them personally, they crumble into repeating their baseless mantras.

However, due to the virus, there is no audience at the moment which actually leads to better discussions between the panel with not so much shouting over each-other or political point-scoring.

One of the panel, Richard Horton who edits The Lancet magazine, [ripped the token Conservative politician a "new arsehole"](https://twitter.com/bbcquestiontime/status/1243277467445604352) by pointing out the failings in the UK preparedness for this pandemic and what action has been taken.  It pretty much follows what I had read in a Reddit AMA the other day, that the UK Government were heading in one direction, only to change their minds when they realised their projections were flawed.

Mad times.

Wonder what will come of all this mess?
