It’s hard to accept help from someone.

My best friend asked for my advice about getting his son a laptop to play games on.    It needed to be a certain specification, powerful enough to play a game which I thought looked more complicated than Minecraft.  Their budget is only around £200, which cuts out the possibility of getting something brand new.  The laptop was also for his son’s birthday, so couldn’t be too shabby if it was second hand, which it looked like it would have to be.

They had purchased something from Amazon as a second hand item, but ended up sending it back because it was badly scratched.

I suggested a few options, advising him to check on local Facebook groups and Gumtree, but there was nothing that met the requirements.  We also checked what was available on eBay, but it is hard to tell what is a scam and what is legit on there.  However, I did find an ACER gaming laptop on Gumtree that would be perfect, but it was £360.

I probably made a big mistake, but I offered to send him the money to pay the difference.  I don’t expect to get the money back either.  Despite him being my best friend, I have never met his kids or even seen him for over 10 years.  I just wanted to help out as I know money is tight for them.

It wasn’t a mistake as such, but I know I would feel wounded if my friends were to offer me a gift like that.  I would feel worthless and useless, unable to provide for my family, especially because of the fact that it was money for a luxury rather than for food and shelter.

I couldn’t persuade him to take the money.  I thought about contacting the seller direct and asking her to drop off the laptop to them if I paid her for it.  I am in a position to be able to help, but it might feel like I was showing off.  It’s a hard situation to remedy.

But, as luck would have it, I have an old gaming laptop my son used to use just collecting dust under my bed.  It meets the spec requirements for the game, so just needs a good clean up, spit and polish and Windows updates installing and it should be ready to go.

Luckily, he was willing to accept the laptop from me and I insisted I don’t want any money for it either.

I am glad to help and grateful I am in a position to be able to do so.

Hopefully, he won’t be too wounded by my offer and more importantly, I hope the laptop will be ok!  The power connector is a bit wobbly so may need repairing eventually, but hopefully it will all be ok for him.
