So the UK government just confirmed they are moving into the "delay" phase of dealing with Coronavirus, recommending people who have a "continuous cough" or temperature to stay in self-isolation for 7 days.

The worrying thing is that they were hinting of more serious measures to come when the prevalence of infections are at their highest which could be in around 14 weeks or so.  They didn't say what those would be though.  Perhaps it will be total isolation for any family affected or to shut down society whilst the infection rate is at it's peak.

I am not really sure.

Also, the prime minister also opened with the lines "It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time."

Pretty scary stuff.  The disassociating depressive in me is doing well at seeing this a bit like a film.  I can't quite believe it is real in a way.  I never thought I would see the government appear live on TV to tell people there is a possibility that they might die in the next months.

Now, the worry for me is that the current cough and headaches I have had for a few weeks; should I be self-isolating or not?  I don't have a temperature (so says my electronic thermometer) and my cough is not "persistent" - so I hope I am in the clear.
