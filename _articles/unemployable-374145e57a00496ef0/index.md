I feel "unemployable" at the moment.

If I were to lose my job tomorrow, I am not sure what I would do to find a job.

Sure, I have skills in IT but my current role sits in such a grey area of responsibility, I am not sure I would be recognized for any particular new role.

I am split between support, project management, service delivery, staff management, supplier management, finance/billing, legal, admin, field engineer, sales, transition and transformation and everything around those tasks (writing, designing, teaching, presenting, fixing, escalating etc).

I don't just do "one thing".  If I were to apply for a job, I am not sure what sort of role I would be best to go for?  Should I be going for more of a service delivery role, a senior support role or something else?

Another problem is that I have no qualifications in any of these things, apart from over 10 years on the job experience.  That probably counts for something in some new companies, but does not look great on a CV when the last course you took was in 1997 for Windows NT 3.51!

I wish it was easy to start up something on my own.  Dive into writing for a living, creating websites or helping people with things.  But that does not pay the bills, not immediately anyway.  I have an emergency fund if the worst thing happened and I did lose my job.

I just feel like I am spread too thinly to be able to apply for anything out there.

And lets not even get into the whole salary thing... that is another kettle of fish!
