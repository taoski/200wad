I find money and wealth management quite confusing.

My wife and I are at a point in our lives where our mortgage is paid off, we have had some inheritance and have a fairly large sum sitting in an account earning us 0.01% interest.

But, I am quite a risk averse person.

As soon as I start to look at moving money around, investments, ISA's or even splitting money into separate accounts to minimize losses if banks fail, I get cold feet.  It's hard to know what to do for the best.

I also have a nervousness about pensions.  There have been stories before in the UK of people losing their money as pension companies go under.  Either that, or the employer they were with all their lives suddenly get investigated for fraud.  All the money you thought was being put into your pension was really spent on hookers and coke, or what ever the British version of that would be: A slow dance at the end of the night in a seedy nightclub in northern England and a sloppy kebab on the way home.

Pensions are intangible things that may or may not appear in your future.

I always have the feeling that I won't be making the right decisions.  I worry that when I get to retirement age, I will be poor and kicking myself for not making better plans.

I suppose the answer is to find a reputable financial adviser and let them help us plan for the future a little better.  However, of the pensions I do have, I only know the details of one.  I will have to wait for the yearly details to arrive by post to really understand how much I am due to get.

Of course, there will be more inheritance to come.

That will just add to my overall confusion.
