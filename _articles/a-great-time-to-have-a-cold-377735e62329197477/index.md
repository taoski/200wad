So, with all of the Coronavirus news, infections, deaths and hysteria going round, now is the perfect time for me to have a bad cold.

It has been brewing for a few weeks I think as I have been a bit run down.  Too many late nights, not enough sleep and not great eating habits either.  I have been sneezing for a few weeks and have felt like my chest was a little raw now and again (although not enough to stop me running over 20k a week).

I am sure it is not the "real-deal" but it is enough to make me double-think about going to the office.  I work in a very small team, so spreading something around and reducing our ability to support our customer is not a great idea.

It's hard to know how to react for the best.  The UK government seems to be quite measured and realistic with their advice, despite them being shit at most other things, so until further notice, we are all supposed to get on with our lives as normal.

I still have to go out this afternoon and work from a Starbucks for an hour or so.  Should I be doing that?  Common sense and government/medical advice says yes, but my anxiety says possibly not.
