Quite often, when I lay down to sleep and start thinking about my day, my life, where I am going, what I am doing or not, I feel intense motivation to do things differently tomorrow.

_"This is stupid!  I drink too much tea and it makes my stomach hurt and I am probably allergic to milk!"_ = Make a cup of tea first thing when I get up.

_"I really need to sort my diet out.  I don't eat enough fruit and veg.  I will buy a Nutribullet and get some MF'ing Kale!"_ = 2 biscuits with my morning tea and no fruit for the rest of the week.

_"I feel so shit all the time, I must be really ill.  This is stupid, I am being stupid.  I need to go see the doctor and turn my life around!"_ = continue to wallow in my pit of pain and self-pity as soon as I finish my morning tea.

_"I spend all my time scrolling on Reddit, Twitter and Facebook.  They are ruining my life!  I will delete them tomorrow or set a time limit and become more productive!"_ = scroll through the same apps as I drink my morning tea, wasting another hour of my day.

I am sure I have done this many times.  The last minutes of being awake spur an intense motivation to change, do things differently and be a different person.

But why?

What is it about those last fleeting moments of the day that causes this in me?

I wonder if it is the same as how my wife always comes out of the shower with lots of ideas about her university essays.  The act of being in that small, blank, enclosed space allows the mind to wander freely and make new connections.  There is nothing else to think about when you are just there, standing under the warm water, heating up your brain, letting it roam in the bubbles.

When I am in bed, I have nothing to do apart from sleep, fart, scratch myself and then go back to sleep.  In those moments of inner thought, in the darkness behind my eyelids I am free from any constraints.  I don't have to worry about doing the cleaning, cooking, working, worrying about what mad shit Trump will be up to overnight or even caring.  There are no obstacles in my mind to stop the "future me" achieving anything - until I wake up and remember all the stuff I have to do, the state of the world and how my life really is.

I did some short reading up on this area but couldn't find anything conclusive.  No doubt it is a psychological trick my brain is playing on me or chemical reaction triggering motivational hormones as my body sends me to sleep.  Many people report feeling more inspired, creative or motivated before sleep or at night time.  I recognize the benefits of a quiet house with no distractions, so perhaps this is when my brain just "working" properly, devoid of the white-noise of life?

In reality, it most likely has to do with some sort of "delayed gratification".

The thoughts of the immediate "as if" perfect world in my head fulfills what ever it is in me that is desiring change and better things.  The moment I wake, that feeling is gone and I am stuck again, seeing the long-game I have to play if I really want something different.  In bed, the action is immediate - "_Make Kale smoothie, drink for weeks, feel like a Vegan God!_" compared to "_Right, I need to buy a smoothie maker, how much, where from, which is the best one?  Where will I get this constant fridge full of veggies from?  Maybe Kale tastes like feet anyway!_".

Right, time for action.

_"Grand enlightenment is never coming. That's the secret. Do it now or do it never."_

But, hmmm.  I wonder what Trump did say overnight...
