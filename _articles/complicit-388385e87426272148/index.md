The ideas of taking a poetry class I had yesterday amounted to nothing.

I did look on SkillShare and found one that looked interesting, but the thought of joining and admitting to my wife that I was doing it felt kind of, stupid?

It's a hard feeling to pinpoint, but is the exact feeling I get when thinking about sharing my writing here.  No-one else knows about it and I would feel foolish if I admitted it, especially to my wife.

I spend so much of my life doing things for her, my family and others that I don't really know who I am any more.  Any attempt at me doing something for myself ends up feeling unrewarding and guilt inducing.  When I am at home I am in full reactive mode, waiting for the next "Dad?" or "Can you just help me with this?" question.  Some days, I may as well put a spring on my ass.

I have the feeling she is not interested in me, what I do or what I want.  I live in her world, talk about her life and what she is doing all the time.  I don't get a look in.  And if I did, I wouldn't talk about myself anyway.  We are the perfect couple, the egocentric with low self-esteem and the complicit introvert yes-man.

Sure, a marriage-limiting comment, but true all the same.

However, I know I was also feeling down yesterday more so than usual.

I had not slept well the night before, drifting into strange dreams only to be pulled back with a feeling like I might wake up in the morning infected by Coronavirus.  Did I have a temperature and pains, or was it just indigestion and acid reflux making my chest hurt?  I felt distant and exhausted all day afterwards, not willing to help anyone, do anything or be anything.

Sometimes I feel like it is not even worth it any more.
