I am finding running hard work at the moment.

I can't tell if it is just because I am a little out of shape from not running much during the lockdown, the hay-fever season (not that I suffer from it), the summer temperatures rising, or that there is something else wrong with me.

I am trying to run every other day at the moment, hitting a minimum of 5k per run.  I see this as a "normal" distance now and it should take me around 28 minutes to complete.

I ran twice earlier in the week and I have been building up to the 5k distance, hitting it on Friday evening.  But yesterday, I felt like I could have given up at 3k.  However, it was hot, already at around 20 degrees desite it being before noon.

I believe my main issues are follows:

1.  **I don't hydrate myself well enough.**  I drink a lot of tea but not much water during the day.  I also have at least 1 coffee and a beer at night.  All of this adds up to filling my body with diareutic liquids.  Not ideal if you want to then go and run when it is hot.  Nothing hits home more than when I come back from running, can down 2 pints of water and not piss any of it out for several hours.  I probably need to give up tea and coffee.
2.  **It's too hot.**  When I first started running properly, it was September, just as the UK starts to get colder.  I think that due to starting during that kind of weather, I am more comfortable when it is colder.  The heat just gets to me when I run and exhausts me quickly.  I much prefer a run at 4 degrees, still in just shorts and a running t-shirt.
3.  **I have a problem with my neck and back that needs to be looked at.**  When I run, the first place I start to feel pain is between my shoulderblades and around my sternum.  I can feel a tightness on a specific part of my back which radiates around my ribs to my sternum.  It also makes my hands go numb too, which points to a trapped nerve somewhere.  My neck is also usually quite stiff and painful even when I am not running, so when I do, I can feel the tension at the base of my skull.  It's not a pain that stops me from running, but it is a constant nagging reminder that does not go away.
4.  **I run too fast.**  I know you should find a comfortable pace but I often glance down at my running watch and see I am going too fast.  Of course, these devices are never 100 percent acurate, but they are a good indication of your speed.  I also find it hard to run more slowly.  It's not a natural feeling at all to slow yourself down.
5.  **Shorter runs are not always best.**  I find I can settle into a run better after completing around 7k.  My body feels more relaxed by then, my heart rate has probably hit it's peak and gone down and I feel like I can carry on further.  Even getting to 5k at times is a struggle.
6.  **I have a weak body.**  I can run, but the rest of my muscles are quite weak.  Having a strong core is good for getting a better running form, so perhaps I need to do some yoga to help.  I often have a tightness or soreness just above my left hip after running.  Again - better core muscles will help.
7.  **I need new shoes.**  The app I use to track my runs, Strava, also allows you to monitor the distance you have covered in your running shoes.  You add your new pair in the app and it will tell you once you reach 400-500k, reminding you to get a new pair.  My current pair are nearly a year old now and apart from the 600k I have covered in them when running, I also wear them as my normal shoes too - so the real distance is much, much higher.  Of course, during lock down, getting out to buy a new pair has not been easy.  I am not that impressed with the pair I have, so would like to choose a new brand if possible.
8.  **Running alone is harder.**  When I started running, I joined a beginners group.  We were all building up to 5k and it was fun.  I made new friends and I found running in a group much easier than going solo.  When I run on my own, I am more inclined to feel I am able to stop.  Especially, if there is noone else around.  When I am running in a group, it is easy to run along and just follow the person in front of you, taking instructions from the run-lead.
