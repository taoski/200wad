I have a few friends who travelled abroad in the last few weeks for some winter sun and have now either gotten stuck at their resorts, or have had to change their flights to leave earlier than planned.

In my opinion, it was a pretty silly thing to do, to try and fly abroad with the current virus problems.  Not just because of the potential for being infected but just because of the possibility that the flights are going to get cancelled and you’re going to get stuck at the resort where you are.

Each day it seems that things are getting worse and more flights and travel is going to be cancelled so what’s the point in putting yourself at risk of getting trapped somewhere where you don’t want to be and possibly can’t even afford to be.

I know one of my friends who is in Spain at the moment who is being held to ransom or hostage by the hotel where they’re staying.  They need to stay for at least one more week due to their flight home being cancelled and the hotel want to charge much more money than would normally be paid.

Of course, it is also possible that the rearranged flight home might be cancelled too.  As the hours and days pass, more countries are going into a travel lockdown.

Another friend is flying back from Cyprus a few days early as they have been told the country might get locked down shortly.

Another friend was trying to fly to Lanzarote and was turned away at the UK airport as all flights were cancelled as he was driving there.

Not the worst places to get trapped in, I guess, but not ideal.  Especially if you have nowhere to stay.

I don’t know why they risked going in the first place.
