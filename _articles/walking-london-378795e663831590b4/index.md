I have been doing a bit of walking around London this morning, waiting for my wife to finish a lecture at her University.  We plan to bum around for the rest of the day somewhere and head home in time for dinner.

I am not sure I could live in London.  The hustle and bustle of even going for a coffee seems too much and having to shoehorn yourself into a seat sharing a table with quite a few others is not something that I tend to do in my home town.  Perhaps it is also a British thing, wanting your own space, feeling awkward in the close presence of a stranger and their MacBook.

I know people who have lived here and have found it a lonely place unless you have a partner or small children and can integrate with the local parents around the hub of school.  Again, perhaps I just can see me putting myself out there to meet new people.

I like my small town mentality.  I see people I know every day.  I still see my old teachers I had before I was 10 in the high street.  I know the alleys and paths, the parks and fields.  I know where I am back home.

However, there is something nice about just being an invisible observer for the day.  Passing through streets and shops, seeing how other people and cultures all live and integrate together.  I can sit quietly in the coffee shop and eavesdrop on the couple sitting next to me, worrying about Coronavirus or if they will get the job they applied for.

It's fun to be anonymous for a short while.
