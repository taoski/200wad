Yesterday, I installed a copy of our online banking app to my wife's phone for the first time.  She has been waiting for some money to arrive and kept asking me several times a day to check for her.  So I cut out the middle-man (me) and gave her access.

For some reason, we seem to have fallen into the type of relationship where she leaves "all of that stuff" to me.  I am not even sure if she knows which company we get our gas and electricity from, have car insurance with or get our milk delivered by.  Of course, it is all there in the app now, so it will be interesting to see how much interest she starts to show.

She already quizzed me about a £70 deposit from Amazon, which she thought was a refund, but was actually the monthly earnings from one of my websites.

In fact, I hope she does show more of an interest.  I sometimes imagine myself passing away, leaving her not knowing what to do to pay for something, or even how to access the bank accounts, crying "My husband dealt with all of that..."

I think that over the years, she has become less independent and more reliant on me doing everything.  This got worse after she injured her arm, meaning I have to drive all of the time and do most of the manual work at home.  Not that I am complaining.  I enjoy looking after people and helping them, so it is second nature to me.

There was a time when she was the more mature one with money and organizing things.  She is a little older than me and had already had her own mortgage and credit cards.  It seemed like I was the one who needed looking after, back then.
