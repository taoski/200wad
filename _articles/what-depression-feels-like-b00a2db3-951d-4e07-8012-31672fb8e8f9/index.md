Like your mind is full of clouds and even making the smallest, easiest decision feels like too much effort.

Like you are useless, unwanted, stupid, lonely, ugly and worthless.

Like you want to be on your own, but kick yourself for being lonely.

You just feel tired all of the time, no matter how much sleep you get.

You body aches or feels weak.

Things you used to love are just not interesting or fulfilling any more.

Hobbies and activities seem pointless, or you start them and give up almost immediately.

You feel like you can't do anything right.

You have both anxious feelings and lethargy, which traps you in constant bad feelings.

Time has no meaning.

There is nothing to look forward to and life feels boring, repetitive and stupid.

You are closed off emotionally, not able to feel anything or if you do, it is from something stupid or insignificant.

You don't have as many showers as you used to and changing your clothes each day is too much of a chore.

You spend too much of your time in your bedroom, just sitting, watching television or revolving around the same social media sites over and over again.
