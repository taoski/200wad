As I lay in bed this morning, waiting for my alarm to sound, for some reason, I started thinking about my IT career and how far things have come.

Fresh out of art college, I started a temporary job as an admin person in a finance department.  I quickly became known as the guy who was "good" on computers.  This was back in the days of SuperCalc, Lotus123, Rapidfile and WordPerfect.  This was before Microsoft Windows had come along.

Soon, Microsoft Windows had arrived and I got taken on permanently at the job and moved into a different position, working on a RapidFile database.  After Microsoft Access 1.0 came out, I learned how to use it and replaced the old DOS database with a new MS Access one, improving the productivity of the department.

Again, I got noticed for my skills and was moved to another team looking after a UNIX based system that managed vehicle repairs.  The application was written in Progress4GL and I taught myself to write complex reports and system enhancements.  I was also tasked with replacing the existing RapidFile database system use to manage vehicle breakdowns with an Access version.

I was learning a lot at this time.  Everything was new and exciting and was moving along at a fast pace.

I was asked to temporarily take over the PC support role for our head office (500 people) as the main guy was leaving.  Of course, I accepted and was eventually taken on as a Computer Manager to cover that office, plus some remote locations nearby.  I still couldn't drive at this time and the company paid for my driving lessons and test.  I passed the first time, went back to the office, called the vehicle workshop and went to pick up my company car.

This was in 1995, still before networking was being used and no one in the company even had email.  All of the printers were still dot-matrix, connected by miles of snaking parallel cables joined to manual switch-boxes to be shared.  I carried around with me a large folder of floppy disks to reinstall DOS, Windows 3.11, Microsoft Office and other applications.  I was also taking computers apart and upgrading them or replacing faulty items.  Computer use was ramping up in the company at this point, so I was very busy.

At some point around 1996, a few Ethernet CAT3 network connections appeared in the floorboxes of the office to connect certain equipment.  There were already a handful of Telex 3270 terminals in the office for people that needed access to the mainframe, connected by Coax cable.  Then, a UNIX server appeared in our "comms room" (a large, makeshift cupboard) and a few of the IT department started to use MS Mail and Schedule+ across the network.  We soon had a bank of modems in the comms room which became our remote access service as people started to need more connected applications.

When I gave people new laptops, soon with Windows 95 I would set them up on MS Mail even if they didn't want it, which at that time, most people didn't.  But, they quickly went from not wanting it to not being able to do without it for 5 minutes.
