I started watching After Life season 2 on Netflix this week.  Blimey, it has been a rough ride.  There is something about that show that is quietly depressing, cringe-worthy, sadly soul destroying but also uplifting too.

I am not sure if it is that I am empathizing with the main character, Tony, who is going through a really rough time after his wife has died, or that I see the sad part of myself in him and the collective cast of misfits and losers.

The way it is written and filmed immediately makes me feel like I want to cry.  The sad, slow music that plays as Tony shuffles across his kitchen to feed his dog.  He looks annoyed that he even woke up alive.  Ricky Gervais manages to convey a lot of feeling and emotion with his subtle acting.

But as well as much sadness, there is also hope and light.  People are falling in love, finding their way in the world and getting through their strange lives.  It is a celebration of being different and unique in your own sad little way.

It is lucky it is supposed to be a comedy.  Without the odd injection shot of humor, it might be too hard to watch.  Again, the comedy can be quite subtle and often based more from character observation, but it is all so clever.

I accidentally read a spoiler for the last episodes, so god knows where that will leave it for the next season.
