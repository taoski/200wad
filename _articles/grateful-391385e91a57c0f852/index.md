As I made myself a cup of tea this morning, it dawned on me how lucky and fortunate I am.  I have a house I own outright, a good job, healthy family, money in the bank, a car, food and could probably buy anything I wanted (within reason of course).

So, with all this abundance of things to be grateful for, why do I still feel like shit about everything?

I guess the obvious answer is that it is easier to dwell on the bad things.

Because I take for granted that I have the things I need to live, I can only focus on and complain about the things I don’t have, or that are not going my way.  The smallest negative feeling overrides the positives in my life.

I have tried to practise gratitude before but found it hard work.  It felt stupid and pointless and I gave it up too soon.  I wonder if, after a while, you are able to appreciate the tiny things we take for granted in a more wholesome way?  It seems silly to thank the tea-bag for being delicious or to be grateful for the electricity that powers the kettle.

I sometimes wonder if being religious gives you that same gracious feeling?

Sermons constantly preach the positives of believing in (your) God and living a good and thankful life, caring for others and being “good”.  Would that regular and repetitive mantra cause you to be more positive and see things in a better light?  I don’t “believe” and have none of my family are religious either, so I don’t have any personal perspective on it.  But from the religious people I know, even losing a leg (literally) is seen in a positive way.  Their God is testing them, rather than punishing them, making them into a more focussed and better person, not bitter and resentful.

Perhaps I need to start small, praising the tea-bag and kettle each morning is an easy task and one that I can remember to do.  I am already in a regular habit of making a cup as soon as I get up, so “stacking” that on top should be easy.
