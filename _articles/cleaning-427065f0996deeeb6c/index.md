I woke at 0730 this morning, stumbled out of bed and downstairs to have my usual cup of strong tea and biscuits.  I normally have this whilst sitting and scrolling through Reddit or Twitter, catching up on all of the craziness that has happened whilst I was asleep.  Yes, America, I am looking at you.

But today, I remembered I needed to clean the stove top.  It was getting thick with grease from frying fish and where pasta had boiled over.  It was well overdue a good clean.  It is generally not a task I relish and usually put it off until it really needs doing.  I always make the excuse that I can’t do it after cooking as it is still too warm to clean properly, so it gets left, day after day.

So, I popped on a podcast and set about the task.  I still had my tea and biscuits but I also achieved something tangible, rather than feeling vague indignation about something I have no control over.  I also emptied the bins and took out the trash.

By the time my wife got up 30 minutes later, the stove was clean and I made us both breakfast and we watched the news on the TV.

I felt more productive and wanted to do more, so after breakfast I pulled the mountain of ironing from the cupboard and sorted it into its relevant piles.  Again, not a task I enjoy doing, so only do it when the cupboard is overflowing.  It also allowed me to finish the podcast too.

Everyone else is up now, so until they go out or start doing what ever they are supposed to be doing today, I feel I can’t do much else.  I want to clean the bathrooms and vacuum too and then I have a small job to to in the garden, sanding the gaps in between the paving stones.

I know it is an old adage about productivity, that knocking over that first domino helps topple the rest and today it seems to have worked.

The issue will be what I will do when I don’t have a task to complete.  There are only so many small chores that can be completed around the house.  Perhaps I can then concentrate on writing something for one of my websites or doing something artistic?

I appreciate my passion for getting something done today, but I worry how long that feeling will last.
