I hate being the middle-man.

The company I work for is a global organisation, but has it's roots in Germany.  The majority of the business is still run from there, but certain functions are devolved to each country where there is a local presence.

Last week, I received an email from my German colleagues asking me to provide pricing for a product our company sells.  Because the customer would be UK based, I was the nominated contact to provide this.  We already have a few UK customers of this product, but I only ever get involved with yearly maintenance agreement renewals.  The actual support and maintenance is performed by treams in Germany, but I have to invoice the UK clients.

So, over the last week, I have been exchanging emails with this new customer, providing them with information, pricing, technical data and support, but each time, all I am doing is approaching my German colleagues to get the answers, relaying them back via email.

It seems like an exercise in futility, especially for the customer.

Another issue is that the customer wants a prompt turn-around with this purchase.  With most people working away from the office, I am finding it difficult to track down the right people to review and sign NDA documents, company risk assessments and credit checks.

My colleague, who took redundancy last year, would have dealt with this normally.  As well as having to play "piggy in the middle" with this, the support tickets are building up and other projects are ongoing.  Its all getting a bit annoying.

It would make more sense for my German colleagues to speak to the customer direct, sort his queries, answer his questions and provide the technical information he needs and then come to me once they have decided which product variation to order.  Then, we can go through the procurement process and I can raise a Statement of Work for them to sign.

It's all crappy red tape, really.

After this one is resolved, I will propose that in future, I won't speak to the UK customer until everything else has been resolved.  I guess it didn't help that the customer initially emailed asking for pricing and nothing else.
