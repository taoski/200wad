I caught an episode of Inside Monaco: Playground of the Rich on TV yesterday afternoon.  It made me as furious as it made me feel like a failure.  I was incensed that people with so much money exist, operating in a tax-free haven of luxury apartments, super-cars, mega-yachts and Botox filled faces.

But I was also jealous.

I envy that these people have enough money not to worry about anything.  It seems that they are just playing at life, holding all the cards that Daddy gave them.  Its pretty disgusting on several ethical levels.

It also makes me feel worthless and useless.  I ask myself why I am not rich like them.  They can't all have had it handed down to them on a silver spoon, inserted into their rectums.  There must be business men, entrepreneurs and self-made people there somewhere too.

I struggled with my conscience over my feelings of envy though.  I know I have a house with no mortgage, a well paying job, quite a lot of money in the savings and could almost buy what ever I need.  But my attempts to show myself some gratitude didn't work.

The thing that put the final nail in my "coffin of hatred" for the Monégasque mega-twats was when the interviewed three women who had a company set up to help people move to Monaco, become citizens, find apartments, schools for their children and set up the tax-free banking they need.  But they also advise people on their liabilities when owning a super yacht.  The idea is that you set up a shell company to own the yacht, so you have no personal liability if anything goes wrong.

In 2019, a boat crew member was killed at Cannes Film Festival after 2 giant yachts collided, crushing him.  He later died in hospital.

The company in Monaco used this as an example that you should protect yourself from being liable for deaths like that, if you are fortunate to own a massive luxury boat.

I mean... fuck that guy who died.  As long as you are personally protected from any comeback, right?
