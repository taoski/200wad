I read an interesting post on Reddit the other day, [discussing how people have implemented or applied](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/i63k2t/ways_that_you_have_applied_atomic_habits_in_daily/) "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.  I find this sort of thing endlessly interesting.  How people are trying to improve their lives or live better is something I have always been interested in.

I have not read the book (although I nearly bought it once from a charity shop) but I think the premise, based on what people posted in the thread, is that you can trigger your desired habits by attaching them to something else.

For example, if I wanted to drink more water, I could make sure I have a bottle of water on my work desk.  Or if I planned to go out running first thing, I would get my gear ready and lay it out before bed, rather than wasting time and energy searching through a pile of clothes in the cupboard.

One person said that they put a book in the bathroom.  This meant that they would be more likely to be triggered to read, compared to going on their phone when on the toilet.  I know that I have gotten through a few books this way in the past, so it does work.

It also made me think about how I work.  I am quite an effective worker and get lots done, but rely a lot on reminders, notifications or "triggers" to do stuff.  When there is so much going on, having reminders can be helpful to get you back on track.

If I can use similar triggers in my personal life, to remind me not to scroll on Reddit instead of cleaning the bathroom, or to clean the kitchen instead of watch another episode of Parks and Recreation, then it would be a good thing.  In fact, I can also listen to podcasts or audio books whilst I do those 2 things too.  The book calls that "habit stacking".

I will have to look out for a copy of the book now.  I am interested to see what else it says.
