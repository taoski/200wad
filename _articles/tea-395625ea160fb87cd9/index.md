It is 10:30 AM here now.

I slept for around 7 hours, woke at about 5 AM by the milkman rumbling past our window and then dozed until 07:30.

I got up, had a cup of tea with milk and half a sugar and 2 fruit shortcake biscuits, responded to a few emails and scrolled Reddit and Twitter until it was time for me to wake my wife up at 8 AM.

Once she was up, we had breakfast, toasted cinnamon bagel with butter and a cup of tea each.  At around 10 AM, I made her another tea and also had another one myself.

And now, my stomach hurts.  The acid indigestion has started to rise and my sternum feels like it has been punched.  Probably because my innards are churning and bloated, rumbling and gurgling like I need more food.  My eyes hurt and I feel a bit drunk, swimmy or groggy, ready for my mid-morning nap.

It could also relate to the pasta we had for dinner last night (pasta covered in green pesto with a tomato sauce with bacon, topped with cheese baked in the oven).  Even after that my stomach started to rumble like it had missed the desert.

It is clear there is something going on in my body that I can't put my finger on.  Whilst I love to do the British thing of keeping it all to myself, ignoring it and hoping it will politely go away soon, it is getting me down.

Either the carb/wheat overload from last night is still causing me issues, or my body is rejecting milk or tea.  Or, it could be a combination of all of those things.

I have often wondered if I am being affected by some sort of wheat or dairy intolerance.  Perhaps I need to work on my diet more.  I am certainly not eating enough fruit, but do have vegetables pretty much every day (I had a cheese salad wrap for lunch yesterday - so not a full portion of veggies!).

Most apps that I have used in the past become too cumbersome to keep up with.  If you forget to enter a meal or snack, it becomes hard to go back.  Also, without religiously weighing things, I don't believe they are much help.  If you then add on trying to track where certain foods or ingredients have caused a reaction of some sort, it is impossible.  Obviously a severe reaction to something like peanuts is easy to detect (hey... I can't breathe properly!) but knowing if that meal you had two days ago is now causing you to be sluggish and bloated?  Not so easy.

There must be an easier way to approach eating more healthily and tracking any issues.

And now it is getting to 11 AM I am thinking of coffee and a snack of some sort.
