I wonder if I am living my life in regret, not achieving what I could have.  Would I, on my death-bed be happy with the life I have lived, or would I seethe with anger on what I have missed out on?  All of those times I could or should have done or said something, but let it pass for what ever reason.  Would I be angry with myself, or stoic and resigned?  Knowing me, I would probably make sure I died early, just so the nurses could leave on time at the end of their shift.  Either that, or I would play down how bad I really was, hoping to slip away without any fuss.

It comes to us all in the end.
