I succumbed to "wife pressure" today and shaved off my 15-week old lockdown beard.  I was a little sad to see it go as I have not grown it that long before.  But also, I was glad to get rid of it too.  My facial hair is like a wire brush in places, thick, sharp and stuck out at funny angles.

I did catch myself in the mirror a few times over the last weeks and thought I looked quite manly for a change.  If only I had a ripped bod too, I might have looked the part more.  I am certainly not that masculine in my body and features.  I have "keyboard hands" and have never planed a 2x4 or laid a patio.  Hell, I don't even own a barbeque or like steak!  That's a good a sign as any that I am not a real man.  Even the beard can't undo the last 48 years of easy-going middle-class living.

I started by hacking with my son's beard trimmer which, of course, had decided to start to run low on battery as soon as I got past the point of no return.  The blades were locking solid on my thick hairs and it looked like I was going to have to resort to blunting several razors instead.  I popped it on charge for a few minutes and attacked my neck with a new razor, an area of me that I had been keeping less hairy.  Two fingers width above my Adam's apple, my bearded friend told me: shave everything below that.

After sorting that area, the trimmer had more charge and worked better once my beard was wettened with my tears.  Soon, it was gone and a messy bathroom floor was all that remained.

Considering my wife kept suggesting I was too prickly and "stabby" to even kiss her goodnight, she hasn't said anything about it going missing since I have come back downstairs.  I also sent a picture to my mother, who replied "Boo Hoo!"  My father has had a beard forever and she was looking forward to at least touching mine after the UK Government adds "hair stroking" by someone from outside of your immediate household to their list of permitted activities.

Now, I need to catch a few rays from the sun to make sure there are no lighter patches on my skin.

Goodbye lockdown beard.

Go swiftly to your watery Valhalla, at the bottom of the toilet bowl.
