Your WordPress website is like a house.

If you take it at it's basic form, the houses all look the same when they are built.  But, you get to choose what goes in each room, where things are placed and how many of them there are.  Those rooms are the posts and pages you add to your site.  As you add a new post or page to your website, your house gets a new room added.

If you choose to install a different WordPress theme, the design of your house changes!  Your bungalow might suddenly become a condo, or a penthouse apartment.  It looks different, different colors, bigger windows and better doors, but the number of rooms stays the same.  The contents of those rooms also stays the same.  You might get new wallpaper and a slightly more modern design, but the rooms contain the exact same things.  Changing your WordPress theme just changes the wrapping around your website.

Say you wanted to add a welcome mat outside your house.  In WordPress, you can install a plugin that adds the mat for you.  You might get to choose the color and the words on it too.  Want to add a loft conversion or to open a store from your garage?  There will be a plugin for that too.  You can add extra things to your "house" by adding and enabling different plugins.  But if you have too many plugins added, your house can become cluttered and no fun to live in.  So, try to keep the plugins and "add-on's" to a minimum if possible.

However, like houses, websites can be prone to burglars.  That welcome mat is quite old now and some thieves have found that there is a key hidden underneath it!  They let themselves in and that's it - you have been hacked.  They change your locks and set up a Viagra shop in your front room!  Best to either replace the old doormat sooner rather than later.  But, there are also plugins that you can install that become your CCTV cameras or a guard dog, keeping nasty people out.  If you are going to own a house, also make sure you don't leave the doors and windows unlocked.  Using a complex password will help keep them shut.

One day, you might grow out of your house and need somewhere bigger, with room for more rooms and located in a less noisy and dodgy neighborhood.  That is when you start to look for a better website host.  Sure, you might pay more, but you get a house with lots of space around it and faster and less congested roads to and from your front door.  When you move, you still have a house that looks the same and contains the same number of rooms and add-on's.  You and your visitors can get there faster and more easily, that's all.  You then have more room to grow, adding more rooms as you go.
