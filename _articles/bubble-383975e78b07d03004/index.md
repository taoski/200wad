It's hard to know how cautious to be around this virus.

I did read something a while ago along the lines of:

> _If you think you are overreacting, you are probably doing the right thing!_

Should I be picking up each item of post that comes through my door with tongs and tossing it into a fire pit?  Should I be wiping down any supplies that are dropped off to me by others?  How close is too close?

My wife is starting to panic a little and a get a but neurotic about catching it from other people and things.

It will be worse once we finish our 14-day isolation, have to head to the shops and allow girlfriends round to our house again.  We are fine in our little bubble at the moment, but will have to venture our eventually.  Probably when the virus is at it's peak too.

As long as we are sensible I think we will be ok.  We are not planning to go out, we can work from home and have plenty to occupy us.  We are also very close to fields so can escape into areas where there are not too many people if we need exercise.

I am glad I don't live anywhere too overcrowded.
