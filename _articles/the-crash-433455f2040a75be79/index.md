After our mammoth thirty thousand word editing session lasting all of yesterday and into the early hours, my wife is 99% done with her masters degree.  She just has a little more tweaking and editing to do on her last piece of work and then it can be submitted.

I used to worry that she was working herself into the ground, typing away on the computer for most of the day, or with her head stuck in books or remote lectures.

Now, I worry what she will do when she finally submits that last piece.

She has worked a little this morning, but has taken the rest of the day off.  I can see her sitting on the sofa from where I am in the kitchen.  Not sure if she is napping, but she doesn't look far from dropping off.

When she worked in a school, during the holidays, her body would fail, badly.  She would be tired, lethargic, sleeping late every day and super cranky.  Then, she would get a cold and sore throat, just in time to go back to work.  Therefore, I am suspecting that she will do the same soon.

I have already been preparing her for "the crash", as I like to call it.

She is ready to have a break though and she wants to concentrate on getting her fitness back, taking up running again and being more active.  The masters and then Coronavirus has meant she has been sitting for too long and the pounds have crept up on her - which she freely admits.

It will be nice to "get her back to the real world" but I also worry that she will be lost for a period of time.

The worst part will be that she will start nagging me to do those DIY jobs I have been putting off for the last 2 years :)
