I have been thinking more about how I could enter a career in writing.  It is something I enjoy and look forward to each day, but going from a quick 200 word ramble to a paid gig is probably quite a jump - especially when I am not writing with a particular niche in mind.

I wish my writing was more profound and meaningful, helping people with their problems, making them better people or happier.  But I just don't think I have it in me to do that, not without rehashing someone else's work.

If I chose to write about WordPress, which I know quite a lot about, I would also be covering subjects similar to many other blogs.  I would have to find a way to set myself apart from everyone else, coming to it with a different angle or view.  Either that, or I concentrate on helping a specific subset of people.  I once started a website where I was trying to help writers start their own websites, what to include or avoid and how to promote themselves.  It didn't last long as I didn't find it very fulfilling.

Perhaps fiction or poetry might be another option, although much harder to make into a career unless I was able to discover I had a hidden talent for it (which I don't think I do).

I did have an idea that I could write 5 articles on a certain subject, lets take coffee machines as an example.  The main article could be "best coffee makers for hipsters" and the 4 supporting articles could be based around the same topic.  For example, "how to clean your coffee machine" and "which coffee beans grind best".  The main "money article" is supported by the 4 informational articles and the information article link up to the money article.  It's a common way to create content for a website.

But I wonder how much I would be able to sell the "pack" for?

I once paid $120 for a single 2000 word article to be written for one of my websites.  It was a "money page" type article (best xxx for yyy) and it did earn more than I paid for it since it was published in 2017.

So, based on that calculation, if I were to write my "5 pack" articles as follows, I could charge quite a bit (if they were a similar quality):

1 \* Money page = 2000 words = $100

4 \* Info pages = 1000 words = $50 per page, $200 total.

But how long would it take me to research and write them?  That is the question.  If I was fired up, I might be able to write the articles in a single day, making $300 a day, maybe $1500 a week if I write 5 days in a row.

The obvious answer is to outsource the writing to someone else and keep the profit :)

But selling those articles might be a problem too, unless you can find a regular buyer willing to spend that much.  I would have to cold-email sites asking if they were interested in buying them from me.  That would also mean I would need a way to show the articles without them being copied or present an idea of the quality writing I can generate.

It is already sounding like a lot of work :)
