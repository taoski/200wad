? Brrrbbbbbb..... brrrbbbbbbb.... brrrbbbbbb... "Hello?" ?

It has been a little overwhelming so far today.

So many emails flying around, phone calls coming in, tickets for problems being raised and all of them getting jumbled up in my mind so I am not sure which IP address I am talking about any more.

My life operates on other peoples' terms, around their problems and on their schedules.

My work day is almost all reactive, fixing server and network issues as they arise, watching for new errors, updating and closing tickets and allocating them as they arrive.  The phone seldom rings, but emails arrive ten-to-the-dozen, all with different priorities and usually are not always anything to do with me (file them in the magic cylinder).

My personal life is also ruled by what other people want and need.  Cooking, cleaning, driving, consoling, helping, fathering, husbanding, feeding the cats.

When I have time to myself, I sit, not knowing what to do.  I am waiting for someone to give me a task to complete.  I am permanently in reactive mode.

Who am I these days, when everything I do seems to be for other people?

I wonder if I have lost my way, grown up on the wrong path.  Taken the wrong decisions and have not remained true to who or what I am, or was.

I know things change, priorities change and people change.  That is just part of life.

But how can I know if I am happy or content if I don't really know who or what I am?

I better go... Outlook is making those noises again...  Someone needs me.
