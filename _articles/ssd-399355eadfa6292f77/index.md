I upgraded my Macbook Pro today with an additional hard disk to replace the DVD drive.  I had previously upgraded to a 500 Gb SSD and 16 GB of RAM, so adding an additional 500 GB SDD seemed like the logical choice.

My son uses my laptop for a lot of music and video editing and it is constantly running out of space.  He also has a bad habit of downloading lots of MP3s and video files and I never know which ones I can safely delete to free up space.

I realised I messed up though.  What I should have done was ordered a larger single hard drive rather than adding another drive.  It would be more sensible to have a single 2 TB SSD, but it has been done now.  I had to clone the drive across to the new one, which I attached via USB.  4.5 hours later it was ready to install.  I had decided to add the new drive as the primary and swap the older, slower drive into the DVD port.  I had read it runs off a slower SSD connection.

Taking apart a Macbook is scary.  Lots of tiny little screws and tightly routed cables and connectors.  It looks worse than it is, but I did mess up a few screw heads along the way, but nothing critical.  My bad eyesight didn't help much either.

I have not really messed with hardware too much in my recent IT career.  At one point many years ago, I was an accredited Compaq hardware engineer and was taking all sorts of things apart to fix them.  It was just part of doing IT support back then.  You got stuck into everything, armed with a cute toolkit and a bunch of floppy disks.

When I was installing the hard drive into my Macbook, I remembered having to set up hard disks as master and slave, using little jumpers or switches on the actual drives themselves.  They had to be connected in the right sequence on the ribbon cable too or they didn't work right.  Things have come a long way since then.
