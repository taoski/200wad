Something always has to give.

For me, it has been DIY and taking care of the house.

We live in a quite an old house, built in the 1930s, which still has the original wooden sash windows, wobbly hand made glass and original features.  But, compared to my double-glazed neighbors, our house looks quite shabby.

I paid someone a few years ago to come and paint the window frames, but now it needs doing again.  Also, the wooden front-door needs a new coat of paint too, as do the stone window sills.  Gutters need clearing and fixing, drains need clearing, the garden needs tidying and things doing too.  The list is endless.

My issue is that I can't get enthused about doing this sort of stuff.

I am a techie.  I like code, websites and technology, not digging, cement and paint.  It's not that I can't do it, it's that I don't really want to, so subconsciously, it drops to the bottom of my to do list.

I just missed a good opportunity of several dry days where I could have repaired the guttering outside our front door, that drips on you as you walk underneath it.  All it needs is a little sealant (or a slap of PVA glue to seep into the joins) to stop it from eroding my doorstep.  But I forgot, or my brain pushed it out of my mind.

Everywhere I look, there are things to be done.  Its so overwhelming I just don't do any of it.

It also makes me feel like less of a "man".

Lots of my friends are more able to accomplish these tasks, lay patios, erect fences, remove radiators or mix concrete.  It makes me feel quite inadequate and useless, that I have to pay for someone to replace my fence panels, rather than doing it myself.

On top of everything else I have to do at home, cleaning, cooking, caring, washing, shopping, the DIY has been the thing to give.

I used to have a joke I told myself when the kids were little, probably something based in reality.

My wife would be stepping over the sea of toys on the carpet after the kids had been put to bed.  "Wow!  It's so messy in here!" she would say, as she collapsed on to the sofa.  "**We** really need to tidy up more...." she said as she turned on the TV and settled in to watch hours of mindless drivel.

Things aren't much different, even now.

It's my all problem.
