I worry about how I have brought up my children all of the time.  They are 18 and 21 now and are nice guys, never in trouble, making the right decisions and following their passions without any pressure from me.

But I worry I have been too much of a "light touch".

I have never made them do chores, never really encouraged them to follow certain paths or to do better in school.  I almost feel that I have left them to their own devices too much.

My 18 year-old still can't tie a shoelace and has only just recently started making his own sandwiches.  He is creative, muscial, artistic, funny and can be a good laugh.  But he is also a bit reclusive, bored, lost and will probably still be laying around watching Minecraft vidoes on YouTube when he is 40.

I wonder if I had been a bit of a better parent, made more of an effort to steer him in a direction and encourage him more, it might have been different.

I know my depression has played a part (still plays).  I sometimes look back over the last 10 years and feel that I have been floating along side everything that has been happening, momentarily becoming grounded, trying to give advice or help, but then drifting off again.  What was I doing when I should have been on their backs about studying for exams or trying harder at school?

I know you shouldn't compare yourself against others and I am sure my sons will find their own way in the world.

I am just left feeling I could have been better, or done more somehow.

Is that normal?
