I have written before about how I perceive celebrities like Jim Carey, who are rich enough to allow themselves to have "space" to choose how to live their lives.  One minute, Jim was a successful comedian, then actor, but now reclusive painter.  He had the money to be able to choose to spend his time painting, rather than grinding the 9-to-5 to stay afloat.

But I watched something on British TV last night, the Grayson Perry Art Club, where Grayson, an award winning artist and multi-millionaire talks to different artists and about creating art during this lock down.  This week the subject was portraits and followed him as he created a portrait of his wife and spoke to other celebrities, friends and artists about their work.

I went to bed immediately after watching and had a similar feeling about having "space", that he was able to bumble around his art studio, creating what he wanted, taking his time, playing, experimenting and living the artists dream.

I felt quite envious that he was able to do this.  Money helps, sure, but I don't think that is a factor in this case.

He looked so relaxed and at home in his art studio, paint and ceramics everywhere, mess, chaos and creativity in every corner.  And then it struck me.  It's not that he has the space, money and time to be able to do this, it is his calling, his passion, his life.

Then I realized that I don't really have a "calling" or "passion" like that.  Maybe that is why I feel so unfulfilled.
