This was originally a late submission post.  I ran out of time and only remembered at the last minute to write as I was emptying and refilling the dishwasher before bed.  I decided to revisit it this morning to do it more justice.

I had tried to write during the day but had not thought of anything purposeful to write about.  As much as I love a good moan about myself, my life and the world, I like to have a purpose for my writing.  It is often something that I had read, seen or experienced that day that prompts my writing.

I also noticed when creating and editing my [Hobo](https://cowriters.app/words/hobo-393305e986d92699e7) post, that I was able to enter some sort of "flow" or "zone" where I was enjoying the actual writing process.  Afterwards, I felt that the style in which I had written was the style I enjoy most.  Self-deprecating, a little humour injected in, a story about something that had happened, rather than dry non-fiction.  These are also the kinds of articles I like to read too.  A witty, [sardonic column](https://theovertake.com/~beta/frankie-boyle-did-you-ever-wonder-what-youd-be-doing-during-an-apocalypse/) always hits my mental G-spot.

I also believe this writing style follows the type of visual and audio humour I like.  I like British satire, dry comedy, self-abuse and observation.  I grew up in the world of TV shows like Blackadder, or radio panel shows like I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue.  These have shaped what I think is funny.  I just wish I could do them some sort of credit and follow in their footsteps.
