I don't think I have showered for over a week now.  My bristles are turning into a beard and my hair, although short, is getting a bit tufty and matted.

I have been wearing the same comfy tracksuit bottoms for a while now too, although I think I have washed them at least once recently.

My slobbing mood caught me out yesterday.

When my wife and I went on our evening walk, I decided not to bother getting changed.  The T-Shirt I had on, had been worn the previous day and still had a few stains down the front from Spaghetti Bolognese the night before.  I had also managed to dribble toothpaste down the front of my dark tracksuit bottoms, so it looked like I had been a bit lapse with my aim whilst pleasuring myself.

This, of course, was the perfect time to bump into some old friends, also out walking in the evening sun.  As per current regulations, we kept our distance as we stopped to pass pleasantries, waiting for some joggers and dog walkers to negotiate a bridge, too narrow for us all to pass safely.  It only dawned on me after we went our separate ways what a disheveled mess I must look.  I am treading a fine line between remaining "comfortable" during this lock down and looking like a hobo who has been fishing in bins for my next meal.

The lock down is starting to feel like the second phase of a relationship, where I can let myself go a little and not worry about intimately scratching myself and taking pride in farting in front of my significant other.  I am metaphorically letting my trouser belt out a notch and not caring so much any more.  Maybe a little too much.
