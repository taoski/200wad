This lockdown has made my procrastination worse.

You have probably seen the memes too that go something like:

_What this lockdown has taught me is that all those times I told myself "When I have time I will work on my...." or "I wish I had more time to do that thing I have always wanted to do!" what it really means is that I will never do them._

I feel this way at the moment.  I feel I should be getting on with other projects and applying myself to new things or things I have wanted to do for ages, but seem to just find myself drifting between Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and then suddenly its 5 PM and time to think about daily exercise and dinner.

I know a lot of it also has to do with me always being in "reactive mode" waiting for someone to ask for my help, which usually interrupts what I am doing.  I no longer play video games for that reason, especially anything online, because I can't pause and come back to it easily.

I suppose an answer would be to delete those apps from my phone to stop me from being addicted to them.  Either that, or limit the time I can use them somehow.

I worry that my feelings of being unfulfilled come from my procrastination and also the nagging feeling of not taking action when I do have time, even before the lockdown came.
