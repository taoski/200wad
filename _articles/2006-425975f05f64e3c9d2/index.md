Work just feels like a torrent of water against me at the moment.

I can't seem to make much headway.  Too many projects, issues, tickets, enhancements and problems to pick up without affecting everything else.

I know when I have had enough when I physically shudder and grit my teeth when my laptop makes a noise to tell me a new email has come in.

It doesn't help that I am also managing the household on my own too, cooking and cleaning, tidying and organizing everything.  My son occasionally makes me a cup of tea, perhaps once or twice a week.  That is the extent that I get help or receive anything back from anyone.  The rest of my time is just giving to everyone else.

I have to try to remember that this feels like 2006.

Back then, I was seriously depressed but didn't know.  I was just about managing to get through the work day without throwing my monitor through the window, getting stressed when the phone rang and not wanting to speak to anyone or do any work.  I used to go and hide in the toilet a bit too often.  My wife was home with the kids, who were toddlers then, so when I got home, it was full on.  There was no respite.

I properly cracked about 12 months after that.

Am I in the same situation now?  Taking on too much, doing everything in spite of my own needs?

I wonder where it will end.

Or if it ever will?
