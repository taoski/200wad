One of my friends has gone hiking in the Canadian mountains for a week, all on his own.

I can't imagine being able to have that much freedom to be able to choose to spend that time away from my family. I would feel too guilty, like I am asking for something that is taboo or illegal.

And I am not sure why that is?

Perhaps I just know that people rely on me too much. It's not that they can't cook, clean or tend to the house, they just choose not to because I do it all. The few times I have been out in the evening for some reason, the rest of the family end up getting a takeaway for dinner. If i'm not cooking, it's the de facto outcome for food.

I am both envious and furious of his adventure.

Envious because of the amazing scenery photos he has sent us already, the stories of smoking weed in the evening around a fire and living on his own choices. Furious because I know I can't do that myself.

I jokingly suggested that three of us reunite on a manly adventure, knowing full well it would get shot down immediately by several families.

Anyway, the risk of catching/spreading COVID is too high for that to happen.

That's my excuse anyway.
