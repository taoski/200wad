Day 1 of "proper lock down".

I am already not sure what day it is.  Breakfast blends into lunch, into afternoon tea and more government announcements.  The sun sets too quickly and I have not stepped outside, save to collect the milk from the doorstep at 8 AM this morning.

It all still feels a little unreal.

When the 3 week lock down was announced last night, my wife shed a few tears.  Everything has been quite overwhelming for her with her University closing, leaving her masters degree a little up in the air.  She admits she is a little scared by it all, despite our town being relatively untouched so far (as far as we know).

I blustered through it as usual, making jokes on a chatroom that I would not be able to go Dogging this weekend.  It is "my way" of dealing with it.  It's not as if my life is in immediate danger from bombs dropping in the night, just from an invisible killer I inherited from someone else's shopping trolley.

I guess we all saw this coming though.

Too many Brits took their own interpretations of the "social distancing" measures too far.  Their idea of staying away from people by going to the beach was also the same idea thousands of others had too, thinking there would be no-one else there.

I can't wait for the stories on Reddit and Twitter over the next few weeks of people being arrested for being places they shouldn't be with people they shouldn't be near to.

I was telling my Son the other day that this situation is a bit like driving a car.  You can be the best and safest driver in the world, but it's all the other wankers you have to watch out for.
