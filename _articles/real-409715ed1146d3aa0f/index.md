I wish I was one of those people who are enjoying the lock down.

My wife is learning, reading and writing for her masters degree.  My sons are both creating music, making connections with their fans, being creative.  I just feel like I am in fucking ground-fucking-hog-fucking-day.

Routine is a good thing for me in most circumstances.  It helps me stay grounded and gives me less stress.  If I have too much free choice in my life, I tend not to do anything.  But when my routine becomes noticeable, that's when I feel it is a problem.

The number of cups of tea I drink in the morning, the time I have my lunch, what I watch on TV at 2 PM, the process I follow when I brush my teeth at night then open the bedroom window and ask my wife if she wants the alarm on or not.  I find it soul crushing when the recognition hits that I did and said the exact same things the days and weeks before.

I wonder if that is what being old and retired is like?  Will I fill my day with meaningless timed tasks or goals and rubbish just to get to the next, identical, 24 hours.  Maybe this is why I constantly look for the disruption in the news so often.  I sometimes think I want the worst things to happen, the snipers bullets, the asteroids, the chaos and terror.  At least that is something real.

I know other people have struggled to accomplish anything during their lock down too.  My impetus to be creative turns to mush when there are no restrictions on time and availability.  I can't seem to force myself to do anything remotely creative, apart from writing here.  My iPad languishes under the armchair, only turned on to watch Amazon Prime or read the news.  Such a powerful device, going to waste when it has all the time to shine.  And yes, I am referring to myself there.

I wonder how I will look back on this time?

Will I be annoyed with myself I have wasted 10 weeks on doing nothing or glad I got to stay home, safe with my family?  I am not sure.
