My nephew is having his first baby in a few months and they are getting things ready.  Money is tight for them with a new house too, so they are looking for hand-me-downs where possible.  We kept an old cot bed that he used by him, his younger brother and sister and my two kids when they were little.  Luckily, it was still in my loft, tucked away at the back.  We had already let him know that we had it if they wanted it and he contacted us this morning to ask us to drop it over this week.

No problem.

But, getting into my loft is like an episode of Ninja Warrior on acid.  Instead of bright red rollers, climbing nets and ramps to conquer, there are boxes of Lego, stacks of old 90s techno vinyl, all of the Christmas and Halloween decorations and a collection of old guitars I hardly remember my son using before he wanted an upgrade.  Don't even mention the Pokemon cards, which seem to have multiplied each time I come across them.

There is a lot that should have been trashed years ago as we moved in.  Old stereo systems, boxes of CDs, never-played board games, Disney VHS films (not the valuable ones), rugs, carpets, pillows, lampshades and a never ending supply of old greetings cards that my wife insists we need to keep for some reason.  There is also an inordinate amount of old school and college work up there.  Enough to start our own University, I think.

My loft is not big, but like a constipated bowel, it is full of crap.  If I want something specific, I have to dig for it, trying to remember when I saw it last, when I tossed into the darkness as I tried to find a suitcase.  It's a bit like those logic puzzles where you have to park in a busy car park, but you can only move a square at a time.  Shift a box, move into the space, move another crate, shift sideways and stub your toe.  Eventually, you inexplicably get to the other side but can't get back.

I managed to extract the pieces of the cot bed and hand them down to my son through the hatch.  I forgot to mention that there is no proper loft ladder either.  To gain access, you have to use a step ladder in a way that all the stickers on it say it is not approved for.  I am sure one day it will collapse under my increasing girth, just when no-one else is in the house.

But now I have the cot bed, where did I put the fixings for it?  I used to have them tied on to the frame in a carrier bag, but it was nowhere to be seen.

My mind could picture the little cardboard box the screws and bolts were in and I seemed to have an inkling it was at the back of a drawer somewhere.  My mind started to play tricks on me like some sort of GPS deja-vu.   I had that feeling that I had seen it somewhere recently, like I could put my hand on it in an instant.  "In the shed?" my wife asked.  I pictured the rain soaked jungle that is my garden shed and the carrier bags I sometimes hang things up in to keep safe.  "Nah... I don't think I would have left them in there" I said and went back into the loft with my head torch.

I spent about 45 minutes rearranging, looking in every box and bag but could not find the fixings.  I did find an old Sony Ericsson phone, several broken Xbox 360's, an original "chipped" XBox, a PS3, the original box for the 1st gen iPad and some other old technologies.  My first digital camera was there from 1998.  It used a large memory card that I had to slot into a floppy disk adapter to read the files!  Funny how things have come along over the years, but I still have copies of those original shots I took.

I gave up, dejected and had a coffee, also checking the under stairs cupboard, the kitchen cupboards and under our bed again.  Nothing to be found.

As a last attempt before looking in the loft again, I checked the shed.  It is old and broken, leaks like a geriatric after 10 pints of lager and is 90% full of things I don't want any more, but am too lazy to take to the local refuse tip.  3 bikes, an old skateboarding rail, and old office chair, bathroom cabinet and a collection of tiles and random bits of metal.  I checked in my toolbox, which had partially filled with rain.  Nothing of use in there any more, unless I needed to quickly catch tetanus.

I removed a bike and the office chair, allowing me to delve deeper and at the back, I spied an old pink plastic bucket resting on an old shelving unit.  The sort of bucket you take to the British seaside when you are 4, wanting to build sandcastles in the balmy subzero summer winds.  And in the faded bucket, among a collection of other random dry screws, was the cardboard box containing the fixings for the cot bed!

If only I had listened to my wife sooner, she gleefully pointed out.
