As I have written before, I like to hang around on the WordPress and SEO sections of Reddit, trying to give help as best I can.  Yesterday, I came across a link someone posted in the WordPress subreddit, leading to their article on the “Definitive WordPress SEO Guide 2020” or something similar.

As with these sorts of spam posts, there was no real content in the Reddit post apart from a quick summary of how it will help, and then the link to the article.  Out of interest, I clicked through and read.

As I suspected, it was written by someone who has English as an additional language, most likely someone from India.  The article itself was just a rehashed list of basic SEO ideas and methods, with links to some tools and plugins you could use.  You could have easily found the same information elsewhere, covered in more detail.

But what struck me was the grammar.  I am not the best at “the grammaring” but because this person was not a native English speaker, the article read like a half translated, jumbled mess.  Many words seemed to be missing and sentences were not structured correctly.  If Google were to read this article, it would fall flat on it’s face, not meeting any sort of quality scoring (if that is what Google uses).

As soon as I read something like that, I just want to click the back arrow to leave as quickly as possible.

It made me wonder if there is potential for a service that corrects English grammar mistakes from writers like these?  Obviously, there are tools like Grammarly which can help, but they are never fool-proof.

I wonder if it is a service that could be offered via Fiverr or for a monthly retainer fee?  Perhaps offering to go back through existing articles on a website and fixing up the grammar might also be something that could be of value to people, if the price is right.  I suspect it already exists.

I know there are people in roles akin to an editor, who’s responsibility is to check articles before they are uploaded to a WordPress blog.  With a team of writers, the owner also needs to hire an editor for quality checking too before it is uploaded.

Perhaps that is a job I would be interested in doing.

Not sure how much people would pay for it though.
