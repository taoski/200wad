Last night, my friend messaged me a link to an [article by Wil Wheaton](https://medium.com/@wilw/my-name-is-wil-wheaton-i-live-with-chronic-depression-and-generalized-anxiety-i-am-not-ashamed-8f693f9c0af1), on his long struggles with anxiety and depression.  He recounts that he was anxious from a young age and then depressed, not getting help from his family because (he thought) they saw mental health issues as a weakness - definitely not something to talk about openly.  Despite being rich and famous, he was dying inside, stuck in a world he could not cope with and had no one to support him.

It was his wife that persuaded him to get medical help and has led him to become "better" and able to speak about his problems.

I applaud his bravery of being able to talk about his problems like this.  It seems like the article is based on a speech he gave, so it is not even as if he gets to hide behind a website (like I do).  But I am definitely not in the same place as him.

Perhaps it is a British thing or my own insecurities, but I can't imagine being able to tell my wife I am struggling.  Even on my lowest days, I am able to function, make food, quip and make jokes, get jobs around the house done and be a father and husband.  But inside I am wanting to run away, crawl into bed, reach for a cigarette or lager.  On the worst days, I am thinking about how I could end my life - or rather, what situations might lead me to take that choice.  It's a scary thing, but not there all the time, so I know it is just part of my black cloud days.

Wil took medication, anti-depressants, to manage his bad feelings, but again, this is not something I could do.  I don't even take Paracetamol when I have a headache.  Filling myself with (the bad kind of) drugs does not appeal to me at all.  I guess if it became that bad I would have to, but it is never on my radar.

One of my other friends apologised for being offline for a few days.  He had been feeling down and was having "existential dread" feelings so stayed in bed all weekend.  It made me realise that I could never do that, give myself permission to lounge in bed feeling sorry for myself, let alone explain to my family that was what I was doing and why.

Perhaps this just shows that the relationships I have with my wife and family are not "right".  These are the people that should have my back and exactly who I should be able to open up to.  It was Wil's wife who noticed he was struggling, not that he admitted it to her and she was oblivious.  I don't think my wife sees anything like that in me.
