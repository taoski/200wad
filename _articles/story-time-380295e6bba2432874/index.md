These last few weeks have really felt like the plot of a film for me.  I suffer from depression, so am able to disconnect from reality to some extent, which may or may not be a bad thing, depending on how you see our current predicament.

I was watching something on TV last night and suddenly "came round" and remembered that this situation is real, that people are going to die and that it could have a massive impact on our world.  My parents are old, so they are at risk - something I never really consider on a day-to-day basis.

In situations like this I also have a recurring thought of what I might be able to see if I went into the future and was able to report back.  I have had the same thoughts about Brexit when things were at their most crazy.  This is probably still part of me disassociating from the reality, thinking of it like a story, flicking through the pages to find out what happens at the end.

We are living in strange, scary times.

I wonder how it will be looked back on in years to come.

I hope we can all pull together when it gets really bad and work towards a better future.
