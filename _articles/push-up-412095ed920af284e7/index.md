I didn't mean to do it.

I got up from my chair in the kitchen where I work, walked into the front room, doing some vague sideways twists to loosen up my back and for some reason, I dropped to the floor .....

to attempt a push up.

It was just a spur of the moment thing, not planned at all.

I managed one.

Just a single, shaking, forced push up.  I dipped to do some more and couldn't make it back up to straighten my arms.

Shit.  I am truly a weakling.

I can run half-marathons in just over 2 hours, but can't even do 2 push ups?

I struggled to my feet and looked in the mirror.  I sometimes feel that my body is quite wide compared to my arms, a little like [this statue](https://news.images.itv.com/image/file/115187/e6d813235315de90_1352153460_9j-4aaqsk.jpeg).  I am not "ripped", "buff" or "cut" by any stretch of the imagination.  I drive a keyboard all day, so am "podgy", "chunky" and slightly "dad bod" instead.

I have always though that being more athletic than strong is a good thing.  I would prefer to tell someone how fast or far I can run than how many times their body weight I can dead-lift.  But perhaps I have taken that a little too far.

Time to think about getting some physical fitness back.  But did I have it in the first place?
