I took a COVID test the other day.

Not because I have symptoms though. I was chosen at random to take part in an at-home survey to see how large the zombie horde will be when we form.

We have had colds in our household over the last few weeks. Sore throats, a slight cough now and again, sneezing, runny noses but no temperatures or other symptoms.

It will be interesting to see if my test comes back positive.

I don't think it will, but there is always a chance we have been asymptomatic.

Generally, we have all been very careful. We haven't been out much or met with many people, only doing food shopping once or twice per week. We are also good at wearing masks, washing our hands as soon as we come in and we still disinfect our food once we get it home from the store.

In theory, we should be low-risk of catching it, especially as our town has a low number of infections according to the official figures.

But I am wondering how my test results will arrive?

Will I get a phone call? A text or email? Or will a van arrive and I will be carefully bundled into the back by some men in hazmat suits?

Only time will tell.
