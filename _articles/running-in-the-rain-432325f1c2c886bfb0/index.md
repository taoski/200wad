The dark clouds are gathering.  A storm is on it’s way and the distant rumble of thunder signals what I have been waiting for all day.

A run in the heavy rain.

I probably look like a total idiot.  When most people are sheltering, staying indoors or putting their umbrellas up, I will be stripping down to my shorts and heading out into the wet.

Running in the rain is a nice feeling.  I don’t like running when it is too hot.  I saps my energy quickly and I tire too easily.  The rain however, is rejuvenating and refreshing on a run.  Both cooling me down and rehydrating me at the same time.

I have only ever run in really heavy rain a few times.  Usually, I look out of the window and see that the rain looks heavy, but when you are in it, it does not feel the same.  Getting thrashed by torrential rain and wind is fun, despite it not lasting that long.

My weather app shows that the heavy rain should be here in an hour or so.  Just enough time for my lunch to go down and for me to get ready.  It is still 22 degrees, so the rain will be a welcome relief from the humidity.

There is only one downside.

When my running top gets wet, it chafes my nipples as a I run.

Ouch!
