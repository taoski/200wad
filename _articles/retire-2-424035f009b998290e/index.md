My friend shared a comic with me yesterday.  The characters were talking about how one of them was living a down-and-out life, giving blow jobs behind the truck stop.  But now he wasn't getting paid, it was a "blow hobby" instead of a job.

My friend jokingly titled the image "Retirement goals".

I wrote about my retirement the other day, how the thought of having nothing to do scares me.  My life revolves around being reactive to others needs and wants.  When that is gone, who am I?

I asked my friend "All silliness aside, what are your plans for retirement?"

His answer was that he could never afford to retire, that he would have to keep working.  He has recently moved back to the UK with his young family and they don't have a great deal of money.

I tried to remind him that in his heart, he wants to be a writer.

I am sure he is good enough to earn money writing somewhere like Medium.com if he really wanted to, but would probably have to buy into that "Blogger" lifestyle.  But the thought of that disgusts him.

It's a shame.

He could be something if he wanted to, had the time, the energy and drive.  Unfortunately, he has been depressed for a long time and finds it hard to start anything.  He has managed to give up drinking for over a year, which is a great start on the path.  I just wish he would take action.

I know he wouldn't regret it.

_(The irony of this post hit me as I was writing it.  I could be talking about myself here)._
