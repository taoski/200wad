I ran 7.5k at 0630 today, but it was already 21 degrees.

When I got home, I stretched, grabbed a pint of water and sat quietly in the garden in just my shorts, enjoying the cool breeze against my sweaty skin.

After I had cooled down and done some more stretches, I decided to have breakfast early before anyone else got up.  I made some toast with peanut butter and a strong cup of tea and returned to the garden.

It seemed like my neighbor had the same idea.

But she came outside to eat her breakfast in just a skimpy bra.  The fence was blocking my view of anything else.  I played it cool, not making it obvious I had seen her, especially as I didn't have sunglasses on.  Perhaps because I was being quiet, she didn't know I was there.  It was a bit awkward.  I didn't know if I should go inside, just sit quietly, make some sort of noise to let her know I was there or ... compliment her on her breakfast attire?  lol - no... not that option.

My neighbor is a bit of an enigma.  She is young, heavily tattooed and looks like a bit of a rock chick, but she is also very quiet and reserved.  I don't think we have spoken to her or her husband properly since they moved in several years ago, apart from the odd pleasantry and Christmas card exchange.  She often wears clothes I would describe as "prim and proper" or a bit "mummsie" but with tattoo arm sleeves or her back exposed, which is covered in tattoos.  The sudden juxtaposition of her appearing in just a lacy bra was a bit jarring.

But, I don't mind our neighbors being private.  I don't want to feel I can't go outside without having to talk to them.  I am sure they feel the same too.  My parents used to live next to an old couple and my Dad constantly got trapped talking to them, not able to easily escape without being obvious or rude.  We had to pretend he had a phone call to let him exit.  I don't want to be in that situation.

So, I just stared down at the floor, slowly finishing my toast and tea and making a fuss of our cat, who decided to jump up for a "snooch" and a stroke.  The neighbor didn't move an inch or bat an eyelid.
