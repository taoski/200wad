I started looking at free writing courses this afternoon, hoping that I would find something I could sink my teeth into.  I quickly found that I was not even sure what I was looking for.  Was it fiction, non-fiction, poetry or something else?

However, what I was looking for was a course where someone was reading and critiquing my work.  I feel that would be more beneficial than just taking a course where the measure of your output was not looked at.  What would be there to stop me from not doing the tasks or assignments?

I the end, I watched a free video series on SkillShare where someone did a drawing using the ProCreate app on the iPad.  I find watching others draw and make art quite therapeutic.  I think I like the processes that are involved more than doing it myself.  I probably won't do anything based on what they were teaching though.  But I do have some sort of vision in my head of how to achieve something.

Again, I am learning skills and knowledge that I won't put into good use.  It will soon fade from my mind if I don't capture it somehow.  I did consider using the ProCreate app to make some graphics for one of my websites.  Some cute characters or logos might look good.

Just another example of how my mind and wants or needs wander, randomly, stopping briefly and then moving on.
