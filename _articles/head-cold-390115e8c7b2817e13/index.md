I wish this head-cold would fuck right off and do one!

I have had it for over a month now and it has ranged from a slight sniffle and headache to stabbing sinus pains.  Along with that, I have had a "thick head" feeling, sneezing, aching eyes, sore throat, blocked ears and general fatigue.  I did have a cough at the beginning and sometimes feel like I have a slight temperature, but the thermometer always says otherwise.

It's like having fog hanging over me all the time, blocking good thoughts and normal feelings.  I can operate, but I am a tired shadow of myself.

Knowing my luck, it is probably the Coronavirus.  Apparently, you can get mild cold/flu like symptoms, but for over a month?  Come on... either get me or piss off! (preferably piss off!).

Of course, it could also be hay fever.  Although, I have never suffered from that before now.

I wonder if my body has changed the way it reacts to things, based on my underlying stress levels.  Is it possible for me to suddenly get hay fever or allergies if there has been constant underlying stress and anxiety in my life?  Has the new fears and worries over the Coronavirus tipped my body over the edge?

I don't ever take any medications, so will just try to up my water, fruit and veg, vitamin intake and rest to combat it as best I can.
