Did a food shop today.

Security were at the door, allowing one in, one out access.  Lines were marked on the supermarket floor in tape, telling us where to stand and how to act.

It wasn’t busy, but was a bit of a free-for-all.  Many people not taking notice, tutting, complaining, pushing past others to get that last can of soup.

I was as compliant as I could be, chatting to the checkout staff about how things had been.  Of course, they are on the front line to the complainers and moaners.  She told me of stories of people getting aggressive with her because of the rules, not following the guidance to queue or stand apart from others.  She said a woman who had come to buy jars of baby food was prevented from buying more than 1 jar at a time, so she tried to leave the store and come straight back in to buy the same product over and over.  The security stopped her though and she left in a hail of abuse.

I am not sure why people just can’t be nice.  We are all in this together, although some do have it worse than others.  Those without jobs or who are facing going from a regular salary to claiming benefits must be in a bad way.

Again, I feel fortunate I am in a secure job with a house and money to spend.

I admit, I do feel a little guilty.
