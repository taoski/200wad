One thing about getting older I have noticed, apart from worrying about my prostate, making a note of the prices of local houses all of the time, wanting to know who in the street is making a noise when I am trying to watch my TV show about antiques or daydreaming about my waning sex-life, is that I am starting to get interested in cooking.

Now, lets start with the fact that I am no home cook.

My regime consists of preparing meals that can be cooked at 200 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and served with vegetables.  I can do mash potatoes and pasta too, but generally the food I cook for my family is semi-processed and probably deep-fried before it was frozen.

I worry that I am not serving good food all the time.  I worry that I won't be able to break out of my mold ever again and that we will be having the same, bland, beige food for the rest of our lives.  The trouble is, I am a fussy eater and don't like to go outside of my comfort zone - ever!

But then came along a TV show about cooking!  I can't remember even which one it was, but as well as using new footage, it also showed cooking from past shows - like, 20 years ago!

There used to be a celebrity chef in the UK called Keith Floyd, know and [caricatured for liking a glass of wine whilst he cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1gx2IBFjE).  He was preparing a salmon fillet on a hillside, overlooking a lake somewhere European-looking.  He boiled some new potatoes and green beans, prepared the salmon with olive oil, salt and pepper and let it sit, getting to room temperature before frying it, adding some butter to baste towards the end.

Once the fish was cooked, he set it to one side (where it kept cooking in it's own juices, apparently) and drained the beans and potatoes.  Adding some fresh herbs and chopped cherry-tomatoes and with some brown sugar and oil, he tossed it all together in the frying pan, glazing it all and soaking up the rest of the fish-oils.

He then served up the meal, simply putting the contents of the pan on a plate and sitting the salmon on top, burned skin side down.  Another dash of salt and pepper and it was ready to eat.  All done in 15 minutes or so.

Easy.

I can do that, I thought!

And I did!

It is now my wife's favorite meal that I cook for her.

I added a little twist of my own by drizzling some sweet-chili sauce on the fish and a little over the potatoes too.

I am glad I caught that show and ever since, I have been watching cooking programs looking for a little tip or idea to improve my skills.  I quite fancy having a go a come garlic flatbread one day.  It looks deceptively quick and easy!
