I'm sure I was still awake at 2 AM, despite starting to drop off in the armchair just after 11 PM.  My legs were tight and aching, jumpy and fizzing with electricity.  My back was also hurting between my shoulder blades.  I guess my body just wasn't as comfortable laying down as it was in the chair, with the violence of my wife watching Narcos to lull me to sleep.

However, I woke at 0630 and decided I should go for a run.

I started doing early morning running when the weather was heating up and quite like the way it makes me feel when you get to about 10 AM.  I have already done my exercise for the day and I did it early enough that it feels like it all happened yesterday.

Empty paths and roads, the low sunlight, refreshing cool air, squirrels running up trees as you approach, friendly dog-walkers and commuters all make it a great time for a run.  It is a nice feeling knowing the soft padding of my feet on the pavement is entering peoples slumber as I pass their houses.  I am up and alive and running whilst they still dream.

When I got to around 5k, I was struggling to remember which route I had just taken.

"How did I even get here?"

I had to mentally back-track, trying to remember if I took a certain path or not.  I remembered running across a bridge with cars underneath.  I remembered wondering if I should strike a victory pose for the cars as they sped underneath me.  But the paths before and after that were a hazy memory.

I managed to work out where I had been, but I guess my sleep deprived brain was also playing tricks on me.

But, I think that is good.

It is a nice experience to "disappear" when I am running.

I forget I am struggling to propel myself forward and just disappear in thought, or concentrate on my breathing, trying not to sound like a steam train with a bad cold.  When I am able to run without too many bad physical side effects, I become free to let my mind wander or just take in the nature around me.

I sometimes count my steps as I run too, if I am finding it hard work or getting to the end of a long distance.  It helps take my mind off the effort of running if I just concentrate on counting.  I count ten steps on one side and then ten on the other.  It's not a perfect rhythm because you have to miss a step to catch the next foot, but it works for me.

In those moments of "disappearing" running becomes my meditation.

That's why I hate running on a treadmill at a gym.

Not only do I not see any squirrels, but I also get to watch my jowls and man-boobs wobbling up and down in the mirror.

Not a great sight!
