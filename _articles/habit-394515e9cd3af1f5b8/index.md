I don't know what day it is any more.  Only the fact that I don't turn on my work laptop means it must be the weekend.  Other than that, the days are the same.

I do the same things at the same time, my own little routines burned into my brain.  Muscle memory or habit.  It's the same.

I am not a spontaneous person.  I am also not one for planning either.  I like to go with the flow usually, take the day as it comes.
