Again, this is a time I feel very fortunate to work in IT where my job can be completed remotely.

The first time was when my wife broke her arm in 2015 and ended up having surgery to fix it.  The aftercare was not great which left her with a frozen arm and shoulder.  A second bout of surgery followed and things are a lot better.

My company were excellent at the time.  I just told them I was working from home for the foreseeable future and they just accepted it.  I also took time off to visit doctors, hospitals, physio, the gym and therapists, all during my work day.  I was able to take my laptop with me to some of these appointments and connect to perform a few tasks.

It is the same with the current situation.  I can just work from home and the work still gets completed.

I am not sure what would have happened if I was a factory worker.  I suspect I would have had to quit my job back in 2015, or beg for some unpaid leave.

It was never my intention to get into an IT career, but it is something I am good at and enjoy.  The added bonus of being remote is just the icing on the cake.
