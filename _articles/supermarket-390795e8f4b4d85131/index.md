I walked out of a supermarket today.

As I collected my trolley, I saw an older woman with gloves on go very close to the person in front of her to get hers.  She was well within 2 feet of him.

We lined up nicely and were let in.

They had security on the door, letting one in and one out at a time but the rest of the store was a free-for-all.  Within a few seconds of being in, I moved my trolley to the side as far as I could whilst gathering some fruit.  As I did so, the people behind me overtook, brushing past me, taking up the entire isle, not noticing or caring about anyone else or how close they were to others.

I had to do a similar move when I was looking for some Vegetable Samosas and sliced ham.  I stood as far away as I could whilst I scanned the shelves, but people were still coming too close.

I was starting to get pissed off.  There were no staff around either to help direct people.

As I rounded the corner I stopped to grab some eggs and someone coming the other way rushed in between me and other shoppers, with a jolly "Sorry!".  The trolley woman with the gloves was also stopping for too long with her husband, choosing things.  There was no room to pass unless I wanted to be within range of her.

Bananas, Pasta, Spaghetti, Potatoes: check.

The end of the isle was blocked with people queuing to pay.  Again, I was not able to get past without being within 2 meters, endangering myself and others.  I reversed and went a different way, but people were coming towards me now and quite happily sailing past, as close as you like.

I wanted something from the shelf in the next isle, but there were people queuing there too.  I stood, trying to decide what to do.  Shall I wait or risk it?  More shoppers were coming from behind.  A flapping employee came and told me to queue in the next isle and seemed exasperated when I said I was still shopping.

In the end, I just gave up.

I grabbed my shopping bags from the trolley, left it where it was (which I never do if I decide to leave a store) and left quickly.

On the way out, I said to the security guard on the front door "It's a free for all in there mate!"  and "People are not taking any notice of what they are supposed to do!".

"I know!" said Mr Security.  "It's a clusterfuck in there!"

Thanks for the vote of confidence in your own ability, mate!

I rushed back to the safety of my car and went to a different store around the corner.  I had to queue for 25 minutes to get in and once inside the store, there was a one-way system you had to follow, markings on the floor showing 2 meter gaps and a sensible system where once you were ready to pay, you queued and were told which checkout to go to.

It took me about 2 hours to do this "quick shop".  And after all that, I realised as I was paying that because of the one way system, I had missed some fruit and veg!  Argh.  I will have to pop out tomorrow to get a few bits.  There is a local farmers market on in our town.  I will go there instead.

In hindsight, in the first store, there were more people wearing masks and gloves than the second.  I am not sure if this was giving them a false sense of security?

So if I do get the virus, I think I know where it came from.

I am starting to understand why one of my friends had a panic attack when she was food shopping the other day!
