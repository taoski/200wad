My wife can be annoying sometimes.  Mostly when prospective trades knock at the door offering roofing, painting and decorating, new windows, doors or the sale of various household cleaning things.  Instead of sending them away, saying no thanks, she says "Oh, you will need to speak to my husband" or "Come back when my husband is in".  Meaning I have to deal with it later.

It happened an hour ago.

I was on the phone in a meeting and someone knocked at the door, saying he was working on some guttering down the road and could see that ours leaked and needed sealing (which is true).  He offered to do it for £30.

"Oh, my husband is on the phone.  You will need to come back in 20 minutes when he is free to discuss it."

Off his little Irish legs went and he came back in 5 minutes, whilst I was still on the phone.

"No.. Sorry, you will have to come back later!" she said, asking him if he had a business card.  Which of course, he didn't.  These doorstepping shysters probably don't have a passport either.

He did come back after I was off the phone and I chatted to him.  He did the usual "Your neighbor is having his gutters sorted.  We are just finishing down the road and will be up in 15 minutes."  The price then started to creep up, but I stuck to my guns.

After all, my gutters did need cleaning and fixing up.

They came back after a while and spent 10 minutes going up and down a ladder, coming back with a bucket full of moss they had scooped out with their bare hands.  There were now 4 of them.  2 Irish lads, one guy who sounded like he was from the Eastend of London and someone else in a car.

I made a point of standing and watching them, so they couldn't claim they had done something when it was clear they hadn't.  It turned out that my neighbor didn't want them to do any work after all and he pretty much slammed the door in their face when they knocked again.

Was I ripped off?

Probably.  But if it saves me going up a ladder to get rid of some moss, all the better.  They seemed nice enough though.  Certainly full of patter to keep me busy.

So if I get burgled over the next week or so, I know who to blame.

My wife, for not just saying no.
