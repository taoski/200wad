I just don't "get" people sometimes.

The UK government has announced that from the 24th of July, we are all to wear masks in shops.  Already the anti-mask brigade are out in force, complaining that they are being controlled, calling other people "sheep" and saying they will not abide by the new rules, claiming fake illnesses that prevent them from wearing them.

It's pretty idiotic.

I think many people in the UK don't believe that Coronavirus exists.  They seem more worried about the thought that governments or big corporations will be telling them what to wear, or injecting them with microchips.  Of course, all of their vitriol is published (badly spelled) on Facebook - the place where your privacy is invaded every time you open the app and probably even if you don't.

The fact that they never knowingly caught the virus just bolsters their opinion that everything was over-hyped panic, propagated by the BBC.  They seem to think that because nothing "happened" that everything is fake and everyone is out to get them.  They still think it is "just the flu" or a cold that anyone under the age of 80 will shrug off quickly.

Why are people so annoyed about wearing a mask?  Why are so many people lacking a simple sense of decency and community that they won't attempt to protect someone else from possible harm?  What is wrong with them?

I know there are plenty of videos on Reddit of "Karens" calling 911 because they were refused entry to a store without a mask, or screaming at people for wearing them.  No doubt, the UK will follow suit in a few weeks and it will be just as embarrassing.

Maybe I can just go a live on an island somewhere with nice people instead?
