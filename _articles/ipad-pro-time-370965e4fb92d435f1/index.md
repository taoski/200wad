I collected my iPad Pro from the office yesterday, with the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple folio case.

It is for a "work project" but the kind of project that only happens at my home, where the iPad never gets used for anything work related.  I am sure you know what I am talking about. ;)

I have been obsessing over getting an iPad Pro for some time now to be able to use the Procreate app.  I Know @hum uses this (I follow her on Instagram) and I am looking forward to using it.  Turns out I purchased it many years ago, so it was a free download!

I have known the iPad was coming for a few weeks, so have been watching YouTube videos on Procreate, following artists and getting my head into gear to be more creative.

The problem is that having to actually DO the creative stuff is the hard part!  At the moment, because the iPad is new, I can get away with doodling, playing with different brushes and effects.  However, I would like to be able to produce something better than something that looks akin to a [Kandinsky inspired digital mess](https://www.arsmundi.com/en/artwork/bild-diagonale-1923-gerahmt-877527.R1.html).

I am quickly coming to realize that using Procreate relies heavily on choosing the right brush that matches your goal.  I would love to make some cute Japanese style cartoon characters or something akin to [Ten Hundred](https://www.tenhundredart.com/).

But at the moment, even finding the right inking pen to do the outlines is harder than you think!  Especially if the way it looks in your head is different to how it comes out on the screen.  Should I be putting more pressure on the pen?  What layer am I on and why is it not a solid black line?!

Still.  There is no rush.  I will just try to enjoy the learning journey.  There are lots of videos and tutorials out there for me to seek out and consume.

That "work project" seems to have been pushed into the long grass ;)
