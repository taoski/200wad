I have thinking more about [the analogy](https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/93309635_2821184891331565_3280398327358685184_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=DZdXp--SMl8AX_AojAb&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.xx&oh=fbe3ced08662e2a1620629ee9b0d76c7&oe=5ECD0F60) @arthurkendall linked to, where the secret of your own passion or purpose is hidden inside you, not something you can get from looking outside.

And I realized, a great deal of me searching for this answer over the last 10 years or so, has been done on my outside.

I have read books, looking for answers, hoping to find that inspirational light bulb moment, followed numerous YouTube channels, Twitter accounts and subreddits where I might get that spark that sends me in the right direction or tells me what to do next.  I have paid for online courses and memberships to join groups of (what I thought were) like-minded people, started a high number of projects all doomed to be discontinued after less than a year.

But I have never properly looked inside myself to find out the real thing I am looking for.  I have probably not been honest with myself or others around me of what I want or need - but that is hard when you don't know the answer.  Sure, I have done "the tests" like KOLBE-A and Strengths Finder 2.0 but they never lead to any different outcome.  The tests just confirmed what I thought or recognized about myself anyway.  Or were they just triggering 

Yesterday, whilst I was sitting at my work laptop, I reached into my bag and pulled out the notepad I use to draw in.  A few months ago, I had cut up some pieces of mail rather than throw them away and stuck a few colored pieces at random on the pages.  The idea being that I would draw on top of them; a mixed-media collage type thing.  I grabbed a black Sharpie and started drawing.

As I was drawing, I was conscious that I was wondering what others would think of the piece.  What would people say if I posted it on Instagram?  Who would like it?  What would my parents say when they saw it?  Was it good enough?

I believe that this is a sign of sorts, that if I am worrying about what other people think, then it is not really worthy of my time.  Should my passion or purpose be something where I don't worry about others views?  Again, I am not sure.
