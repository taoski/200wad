I still feel groggy today.

Tired, but restless, phasing in and out of moments of feeling fine and then like crap the next minute .  I am sure I am running a slight temperature or maybe have some underlying infection somewhere.

At the moment, my main issue is pain on the front of my left hip, like I have been exercising too much.  I haven't run for over a month now (due to my head cold) although we have been religiously walking at least 5k a day during our government mandated daily exercise.

How to get your population to exercise more?  Tell them they can't go out!

The pain moves from being a stabbing pain to a dull ache and back again.  After sitting and working on my laptop for a while, I can feel it aching and then when I get up to walk, it feels tight and sore.  The pain is radiating up into my lower back, groin and stomach too, making me feel like shit.  I would happily sit on the toilet all day as this position seems to be the most comfortable.

I did some yoga type stretches earlier this morning to try to relieve the stiffness.  It definitely feels muscle related, unless there is something more wrong with my hip itself or the surrounding "bits" although I can't really feel it once I am walking - and I am no slowcoach.

More stretches, more water, more vitamins and a hot shower are in order I think.  I need to keep moving too, sitting is not a good treatment.
