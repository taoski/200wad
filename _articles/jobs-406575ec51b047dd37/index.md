Within hours of passing a new points based immigration system for entry to the UK requiring people to earn £25k or more to qualify, the government launched a new initiative to get British people to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms.  For some reason, the lack of low paid, low skilled workers to do such tasks, combined with Brexit, Coronavirus and the new immigration laws, means that there are not enough people to pick!

Go figure!

The website where the new jobs were being advertised was crashing too within minutes.  I did manage to access it though but ended up clicking through to the main UK government jobs website.  I just wanted to see what jobs were in my local area, out of interest.

It became quickly evident that the job I do is very well paid.  Especially as I don't have any real qualifications to speak of to back up my years of experience.  It made me worry about what sort of job I could get if I was laid off at any time in the future.  But it was clear - I don't feel employable in my current state.

I would hope that I could start some sort of business where I either build websites for people (a pain in the neck!) or offer a subscription service such as maintaining WordPress sites for people.  My hours of scrolling through Reddit proves there are a lot of people out there who need help.

I really should be using this downtime during lock down to build up the websites I already have to make more money.  I don't think they are salary replacing assets, but over time, with the right input, it could go a long way to cushioning against redundancy.

I know the job market will be bad at the moment, but the number of jobs available, the requirements and salaries scared me a little.  I wonder how much longer I can safely stay in my little bubble before it all pops.  I have "keyboard hands" not "fruit picking hands".
