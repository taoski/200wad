I sometimes feel like I don't really know what I am doing.

Not in the sense of not knowing my "life goals" or not planning for my future, but just a general sense of having confusion.  It might just be an age thing, or that I have not taken enough time off over the last year, but it can become a problem.

Not a problem like where you forget to turn off the bath taps and flood the house, or burn down the kitchen after forgetting you left something in the oven.  It's the small things like not remembering to do something important.  I have missed all sorts of things over the years through forgetting.

I could use a planner or a diary, but I might forget to use them - and then where would I be?

I think I might just be "burned out".

I have been working hard, doing most of the work compared to my colleague.  Sure, I am paid more than him, but I seem to be more engaged to do things than him.  He moans that he doesn't get promoted or get pay rises, but also won't take on new tasks or projects.  So, I end up doing almost everything.  I don't think there has been a time when I have had days or weeks off and he hasn't contacted me about something work related.

Then there is my wife and her Masters degree.  She is doing amazingly well and is coming to the end, but has been under constant pressure, which also puts me under pressure.  She has been studying solidly for years now.  I have been her editor, mentor, guide, Word document formatting specialist and support team.  I have lost count of the times she has asked me to help her with editing, only to find that she had a 1000 word limit and has written 1500.  How do you cut a third of an essay on a topic you know nothing about?

If someone has a helicopter to whist me off to an island for a week, where I get to do nothing on my own, that would be great.
