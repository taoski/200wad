Writing has been invading my brain this weekend.  I am not sure if it is just a cognitive trick that I am noticing it everywhere, but it feels like it has been hunting me down.

First, an ex-neighbour of mine had a poem published in a magazine.  Turns out she is doing a creative writing degree at Uni and there was a collection of poems assembled from the students.  I didn’t think hers was that good (another cognitive fallacy I fall for that I could do the same or better when I see something someone has done) but I was quite jealous.  She has also created a new Twitter and Instagram account for her writing and has posted pictures of her working, notebooks full of prose and stories (again - a cognitive trick where I start to compare my insides with her outside).

My YouTube was also full of adverts for writing masterclasses.  I had started to have a channel suggested to me where film makers and writers go through how they wrote a certain film or script.  Quentin Tarantino, for example, on how he writes scripts and weaves his stories together.  I find it all very interesting, the process of writing.  I am probably in love with that more than writing itself.

My friend (who wants to be a writer too) then sent me a link to an article in The Guardian about being creative and writing and reading when in lockdown.  Several writers suggested how to overcome the lock down block and get to work by following a schedule and writing every day (what a novel idea!).  Again, their processes interested me more than what they were writing (I didn’t even know who some of them were to be honest).

One of my running club friends also posted her latest blog article about what she had been up to over the last week.  Nothing too exciting, but nice to read all the same.  I don‘t have the heart to tell her I used to blog myself, back in 2001.

I am sure this has all just been some clever mind trick.  When I obsess over something I start to see it everywhere, but this time it feels like writing is obsessing over me!
