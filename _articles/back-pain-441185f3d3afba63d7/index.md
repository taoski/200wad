I had to move a heavy stone planter at the weekend and now my back is hating me for it.

It was being moved from the front garden, to the back and the only way to do this was to go through the house.  I managed to drag it to the front step and then lever it inside, onto a skateboard.  That was quite hard as the skateboard was higher than the planter and it was so heavy, it was hard to lift and shove it on to the deck of the board.  Luckily, my Son was nearby, so he was able to steady it with his foot, to stop it from skating away.

Once it was on the board, wheeling it through the house was no issue.  A lot of the weight was at the back, so pivoting it around corners and through passageways was no problem.

Once I got to the back door, there were three steps down to negotiate, so I had to use my brute strength to tip and maneuver it down, sliding it from end to end, dow each step.

Then, it was only a short drag to where my wife wanted it (well.. where it will live for now until she changes her mind).

I felt my back twinge whilst I was lifting the planter in and on to the skateboard.  I was crouching down low and was trying to lift it awkwardly.  I had the sense to stop what I was doing and approach it differently, but the damage was already done.

It didn't feel too bad for hours after.  It was only at night that the stiffness came on.  At least that means there was no sudden damage, just a pulled muscle I suspect.

Lower back pain can be hard work.  As I sit here and type this, I can feel it throbbing like a knife on my left-hand side.  The pain is radiating down my leg and around to my stomach.  If I don't remember to position myself correctly before I cough or sneeze, I am in agony.  The same goes for farting.  You have to wait until it falls out, forcing one just hurts too much.

I am not a stranger to lower back pain.  When I was a teenager, I was planning to spend the day skateboarding after dropping some acid.  No sooner had I taken the tab, I tweaked my back and was in agony.  I stupidly tightened my belt as tight as it would go, just to provide me with some support.  It was still a good trip, just a bit weird.

Running also jars my back if I go too slowly.  Because my wife has started to try running again, I am doing a slow jog next to her, rather than pounding along at my usual quick rate.  It is actually painful to run more slowly when you have legs as long as mine.

So, the answer to my back pain is that it will go in time.  I won't be taking anything for it though, it's not that bad.  I just need to rest and take my time.  Perhaps I need to give tomorrows run a miss?  We shall see.
