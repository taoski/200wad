I feel down this afternoon.  Tried to my core, sitting watching shit TV, wondering what the hell we are doing here.  The hours pass so slowly when I am in a funk.

I feel so angry at myself for not doing anything, but don't have the energy to take action.  I managed to go and buy some paint, fit a new lock to the back door and replace a broken "strike shield".  As usual, the repairs didn't quite go to plan.  The screws didnt quite bite into the wood causing the door to stick.  The rain was lashing down on me and I just wanted to put a hammer through the door and be done with it.

I will sleep in tomorrow.  I have no need to get up and run.  If I go at all, it can be later in the day.

Perhaps I just need more rest.
