As I lay in bed this morning, waiting for my alarm to sound, for some reason, I started thinking about my IT career and how far things have come.

Fresh out of art college, I started a temporary job as an admin person in a finance department.  I quickly became known as the guy who was "good" on computers.  This was back in the days of SuperCalc, Lotus123, Rapidfile and WordPerfect.  This was before Microsoft Windows had come along.

Soon, Microsoft Windows had arrived and I got taken on permanently at the job and moved into a different position, working on a RapidFile database.  After Microsoft Access 1.0 came out, I learned how to use it and replaced the old DOS database with a new MS Access one, improving the productivity of the department.

Again, I got noticed for my skills and was moved to another team looking after a UNIX based system that managed vehicle repairs.  The application was written in Progress4GL and I taught myself to write complex reports and system enhancements.  I was also tasked with replacing the existing RapidFile database system use to manage vehicle breakdowns with an Access version.  I did some quite advanced stuff on that system.  So much so that when I was called to fix it a few years later, I didn’t understand my code at all.

I was learning a lot at this time.  Everything was new and exciting and was moving along at a fast pace.

I was asked to temporarily take over the PC support role for our head office (500 people) as the main guy was leaving.  Of course, I accepted and was eventually taken on as a Computer Manager to cover that office, plus some remote locations nearby.  I still couldn't drive at this time and the company paid for my driving lessons and test.  I passed the first time, went back to the office, called the vehicle workshop and went to pick up my company car.

This was in 1995, still before networking was being used and no one in the company even had email.  All of the printers were still dot-matrix, connected by miles of snaking parallel cables joined to manual switch-boxes to be shared.  I carried around with me a large folder of floppy disks to reinstall DOS, Windows 3.11, Microsoft Office and other applications.  I was also taking computers apart and upgrading them or replacing faulty items.  Computer use was ramping up in the company at this point, so I was very busy.

At some point around 1996, a few Ethernet CAT3 network connections appeared in the floorboxes of the office to connect certain equipment.  There were already a handful of Telex 3270 terminals in the office for people that needed access to the mainframe, connected by Coax cable.  Then, a UNIX server appeared in our "comms room" (a large, makeshift cupboard) and a few of the IT department started to use MS Mail and Schedule+ across the network.  We soon had a bank of modems in the comms room which became our remote access service as people started to need more connected applications.

When I gave people new laptops, soon with Windows 95 I would set them up on MS Mail even if they didn't want it, which at that time, most people didn't.  But, they quickly went from not wanting it to not being able to do without it for 5 minutes.

We started sharing files from the UNIX server and soon, Windows NT servers appeared in the comms room, providing databases or file and printer sharing facilities.  One of my daily tasks was to replace umpteen numbers of backup tapes, cycling them round regularly.

I can remember being part of the Internet Pilot Project where a small number of staff were provided with a login to use it.  Of course, there wasn’t a great deal on the Internet at this point and I can remember a contractor being hired to create the first website for the company.  Very basic stuff, but pretty good back then.  I bet he was on good money too.

Soon, all employees had email and Internet access.  There seemed to be constant improvements and upgrades, new software, new hardware and I was at the cutting edge of it all.

Whilst I was based at the company headquarters, where I was struggling to look after over 500 users, I was also supposed to be a field engineer too, covering 9 other sites.  I didn’t get out to them very often to be fair.  I was pretty invaluable to the HQ back then and I worked very hard, often doing weekend overtime for no additional pay.  If the office space got reorganised, I would be there to disconnect and reconnect all of the equipment.

When I did get out on the road, I was visiting small regional offices or depots.  The offices were ok, but the depots where dirty and the equipment was old.  Plus, the staff who work in those types of locations were quite old too.  Some of them, who had been working at the same company for 40 years or more were quite resistant to adopting anything new.  They were more used to spanner’s and fixing machinery than trying to use a modem for the first time.

I once drove 150 miles to turn up the brightness on a 3270 terminal that the user swore was broken.  I was very pissed off.

I eventually got some help and had a few assistants work with me.  One of them is now one of the most highly qualified CISCO engineers in the UK.  He was always eager to progress his career whereas I was never as ambitious.  I joined with another team who were the IT support for a parent company and was joined by a permanent member of staff to help.  Things did start to get a bit easier then.  The chaos of the evolving IT landscape of a company had settled to a constant hum.  There is always lots of work to do.

As a more senior member of the team, I was being pushed towards management more often.  I wasn’t really interested to be honest.  I prefer fixing computers to fixing people.  I moved into the management role but asked to go back to my old role after two weeks.

What I didn’t realise at the time was that my depression was really starting to kick in at this point.  Moving to the management role just didn’t feel right.  I was released but my role at HQ was no longer available.  From being a critical member of staff, I was seen as a trouble maker and a problem.  Two roles were offered to me, to either be a project rollout member which would involve travelling around the country, working where ever was needed.  The alternative was to travel 50 miles each day to work in a remote support team, specialising in fixing issues by phone or remote control.  I opted to go for 2 months, but quickly settled in to the team, becoming their star player.  I fixed the most issues in all of the teams in the whole UK and even received an award for it.  I ended up staying for five years, my salary went up, my stature within the company grew, but my depression continued to build too although I didn’t know it.

The company IT teams were eventually outsourced to a large American company.  We quickly realised we were just numbers on a spreadsheet now, rather than valued employees.  Just a cost to reduce, not a benefit to retain.  I opted to take redundancy in 2006.  Again, like when I took the management role, I just felt that something was wrong inside me and that something had to change.  I was really tired and grumpy by then and everything was a gargantuan effort.  I was still top dog, but at what cost?

Looking back, I wonder if my depression was a result of working too hard for too long.  I was certainly under a lot of stress when I was at the HQ office.  I worked way too many hours and was under constant pressure.  Perhaps the result was my brain just giving up.

It’s hard to know for sure.
