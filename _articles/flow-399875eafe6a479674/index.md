Over the last week, I have been thinking of how I work best or what triggers me into doing work or "stuff" I find meaningful, rewarding and fun.  I feel I need to try to identify that "zone" where time disappears and I am in flow, enjoying what I am doing.

I do get this feeling from completing work for others.  If my wife asks me to draw an image for her, recreate a PDF in to a Word document or create some art for a presentation.  There is a definite input and outcome in this task without much room for injecting my own creativity.  However, I find sitting and thinking of something to draw or create too much work.  I don't seem to be able to get the spark to have my own free creativity any more.

I also get this feeling from writing code, trying to solve a problem, creating something useful for myself or others.  I am not the greatest programmer by any means, but I enjoy digging into code, fixing bugs or creating something new.  It is easy to lose time during this process, my full concentration given to fixing something.

At my 9-to-5, I am driven by the calendared events, regular requirements and work coming to me.  When the beginning of each month rolls around, I have no issues completing the various reporting and billing tasks, because my calendar pops up to remind me to do them.  It's not that I wouldn't remember to complete them, but when the tasks are there in front of me, they are more likely to be done.  I am also driven by the completion of new tickets are they are assigned to me.

So, would the best thing be for me to receive a task in my calendar to draw, code or create something specific and provide it to them and then get feedback?
