I know this is going to shock @brandonwilson but my mental health definitely improves the more sleep I have.

Thinking back over the last few weeks, I have been waking up a lot in the night and have been feeling mentally worse each day.  I had not put the two together until I have had two nights of better sleep.

On the bad nights, I was in bed by 12 (which seems to be a thing for us at some points throughout the year) slept until about 2 AM and was then awake on and off several times until 7 AM when I decided to get up.  I think the bright sunshine we have been having recently also does not help.  We always sleep with the window open and the curtain slightly open too to allow for airflow.

Either that, or the stress and anxiety I was feeling was keeping me awake.  There were times when I laid down to sleep that I found myself clutching the duvet or my hair in a vice grip.  I was also grinding my teeth too as my jaw ached when I woke up.  When I was awake in the night, I was alert for noises downstairs and had bad and impure thoughts running through my mind I couldn't release.

I have never wore a sleep mask before and am not sure I would like it.  My wife also does not like sleeping in the total darkness either, so we can't use a blackout curtain or blind.

But it is nice to feel better and it is another realization for me about how I feel and why.  When you have poor mental health, it is easy to wallow in the pit of bad feelings, not looking for the cause or contributing factors.  Clarity helps.
