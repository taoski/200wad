I had to get up early this morning.

I had ordered some additional food from our milk delivery company, to be left on the doorstep.  They usually come at around 05:30 AM each day.

Because of all of the food shortages, my silly brain was thinking that if I slept in, people would try to steal my food.

I had a restless sleep and dreamt about losing things.

I woke at 06:30 AM, put on my dressing gown and went and opened the door.  No food, no milk, no sign of anything.

I made a cup of tea and then heard the delivery truck outside.

I watched him through the window, filling a paper bag with supplies and an extra carton of milk and drop them on my doorstep.

I collected them immediately, careful to open and close the front door quietly.

No-one was going to steal my supplies.

I got 2 additional loaves of bread (now frozen) and some margarine spread (which we had run out of the day before).

The eggs and cheese I had ordered were not available.  Shortly, an email came announcing a partial refund.

Food is not running that short in my house just yet, but I am lacking in "snacks" more than anything.  And ham for sandwiches.
