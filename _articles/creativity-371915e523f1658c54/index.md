Being creative can be hard work on my soul.  I am not talking about the act of being creative and making some art or music, but that of being a creative person.

I would describe myself as a "frustrated creative" with ability in many areas.  I can play the guitar, write music, draw, paint, write words and code and do a bit of graphic design work too.  But, I never or hardly ever do anything (unless it is for someone else).

If you told my younger self that I would end up working in IT rather than in an artistic field, he would have been surprised (but probably pleased too, as computers were pretty neat and rad in the '80s).

I am getting on for 50 now, I have put away my childish things and have taken on the role of caregiver, father, mortgage payer and job-holder.  Where is the art, music or writing there?  It is easy for my life and job to take over what I could, be doing instead.

That dishwasher isn't going to fill itself and that door needs painting.  Oh, and don't forget the clothes washing too.

Creativity gets trumped by the humdrum.

I sometimes wish things were different.  I worry I have not grown into the person I should have become.
