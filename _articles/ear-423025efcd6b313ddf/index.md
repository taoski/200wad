My left ear canal is currently totally blocked with impacted wax.  The tinnitus is quite amazing.  I feel like I have been slapped on the side of the head with a wet haddock.  A haddock who is also accomplished at screaming death metal.

It's not the first time this has happened to me.  I had my ears cleaned by a nurse a few years ago using an implement similar to a Water Pik.  Warm water convulsed in my ear as she scraped away the gunk into a cardboard pot, accidentally pressing her breasts against my shoulder.  Now that most barbers are Turkish men, I don't get that very often any more.  The accidental brush of nipple against you from a hairdresser has been replaced by an awkward shoulder massage from a hairy boy with a steaming towel (that is always too hot, but you tell them it's fine).

Of course, due to lock down, medical intervention is probably not possible.  I might be able to get a video conference appointment with the doctor who can try to diagnose me remotely.  Unfortunately, the iPhone never shipped with a macro lens, so good luck!  I have had to resort to having hot showers (which seem to make it worse) and dripping olive oil in my ear twice a day.  The 3D waxy patterns I can make on the tissue afterwards are quite impressive!

Despite the constant ringing, it can be quite peaceful to be half-deaf.  The television becomes a distant mumble if I am not angled correctly and I can get away with pretending I didn't hear what my wife said.  However, it does make it hard to tell from which direction sounds are coming from, which can be quite amusing, but also frustrating.  Is that a car alarm outside, or is my head singing to me now?

It is not affecting my sleep, although I do have to rest my head on the blocked side.  If I have my blocked ear open to the elements, I can hear thrashing machines, rushing water or that damn car alarm again.  Those moments when you wake in the night, listening intensely to see if an imaginary sound you dreamed is actually a burglar or not, can be fun.  If it is an intruder, he is making a hell of a noise!
